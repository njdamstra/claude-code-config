# Task Context for performance-assessor

You are assessing performance and quality for **{{feature_name}}**.

**Workflow:** improving-plan (assessment phase)
**Scope:** {{scope}}

## Your Task

Perform comprehensive assessment combining:
1. Baseline profiling and metric collection
2. Bottleneck identification and impact ranking
3. Optimization opportunity discovery
4. UX analysis (accessibility, responsiveness, interactions)
5. Code quality assessment

## Input Context

This is the first phase - start fresh with baseline measurements.

## Output Deliverable

Write your assessment to: `.temp/phase-assessment/performance-assessment.json`
