## Your Task

Create a quick implementation sequence for: **{{feature_name}}**

This is a rapid workflow, so create a concise, actionable list of steps. Focus on the essential tasks only.

## Context

Review the discovery phase outputs:
- **Files:** `{{phase_paths.discovery}}/files.json`
- **Patterns:** `{{phase_paths.discovery}}/patterns.json`

Use these to inform your implementation sequence.

## Sequencing Strategy

### 1. Identify Core Tasks
Break down the feature into 3-7 core tasks:
- Create/modify components
- Add data/state management
- Implement API integration
- Add styling
- Test basic functionality

### 2. Determine Dependencies
Order tasks based on dependencies:
- Foundation first (stores, utilities)
- Core components next
- Integration and polish last

### 3. Estimate Effort
For each task, provide a rough time estimate:
- Quick (5-15 min)
- Medium (15-30 min)
- Long (30-60 min)

### 4. Identify Risks
Note any potential blockers or tricky parts.

## Output Format

Write your implementation sequence to: `.temp/{{output_dir}}/implementation-sequence.md`

### Markdown Structure

```markdown
# Implementation Sequence: {{feature_name}}

**Workflow:** quick
**Scope:** {{scope}}
**Total Estimated Time:** X-Y minutes

---

## Step 1: [Task Name]

**Estimated Time:** 5-15 minutes
**Difficulty:** Low | Medium | High
**Dependencies:** None | Step X must be complete

### What to Do
- Specific action item
- Another action item
- One more action item

### Files to Modify/Create
- `path/to/file.vue` - Description of changes
- `path/to/store.ts` - Description of changes

### Expected Outcome
Clear description of what should work after this step.

### Risks
- Potential blocker or tricky part
- Another risk to be aware of

---

## Step 2: [Next Task Name]

[Same structure as Step 1]

---

[... Continue for all steps ...]

---

## Final Validation

After all steps are complete, verify:
- [ ] Feature works as expected
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Styling looks correct (light + dark mode if applicable)
- [ ] Basic edge cases handled

---

## Quick Reference

### Files Created
- List of new files

### Files Modified
- List of modified files

### Key Decisions
- Important architectural or implementation decisions made

### Follow-up Tasks
- Optional improvements or future work (not required for quick workflow)
```

## Success Criteria

- ✓ 3-7 clear, actionable steps
- ✓ Each step has time estimate
- ✓ Dependencies between steps identified
- ✓ Files to modify/create listed for each step
- ✓ Expected outcomes clear
- ✓ Potential risks noted
- ✓ Final validation checklist included
- ✓ Total time estimate reasonable (30-90 minutes)

## Implementation Guidelines

**Keep it simple:**
- Don't over-engineer
- Use existing patterns from pattern check
- Reuse code where possible
- Skip non-essential features

**Be specific:**
- Name actual files to modify
- Describe concrete changes
- Provide clear success criteria

**Stay focused:**
- This is a quick workflow
- Avoid scope creep
- Defer nice-to-haves to future work

## Time Target

Complete this sequencing in **3-5 minutes** maximum.
