    "now run the summary instruction bash script for investigation workflow, tell me what it says, then run the fetch phase instructions scripts for the first 2 phases and tell me what's outputted",
    "Good job! now I was wondering how hard it would to be if we wanted to have both the phase name but also allow for just the phase step number to be inputed into this script",
    "Sweeet, now with these updates, do we need to update the SKILL.md file or the WORKFLOW_CREATION_GUIDE.md (only if the process of creating or retrieving workflows has changed)? also can we add to the WORKFLOW_CREATION_GUIDE that for each workflow they should create a new command in commands/wf/ following the pattern in the current commands like @commands/wf/investigation.md ",
    "now take a closer look at @skills/use-workflows-v2/ . ultrathink how are phases from various workflows reused? Currently what logic is available for reusing phases and how much customization does a single phase offer to be customized by different workflows? '",
    "okay create doc in this folder call INTENDED_IMP_v3.md with all the discovered info that you found, and then concisely list the improvements we should make and how to do it briefly. note that priority 2 (subagent prompt templates) is no longer a priority and is actually smth i want to get rid of completely. I'd instead want to creates output_templates/ folder with output structures. for example, if we want during discovery phase the code-researcher subagent to output a dependencies json, then we should include in the phase template the output template to give to the subagent. note that the template outputs should not specify any directory or what not, just the structure of an output. and this should be customizable in the phase for which output template(s) (there can be multiple per phase / per subagent) and could apply to subagents and or main agent.\n\nAll in all, template override system, extended conditionals, phase dependencies are all important and the output_templates system. It is also super important to ensure consistency in the output directories for each phase and each phase output directory MUST extend the main output directory (i.e. .temp/animation-refactor/ \n-phase-1-prob-understanding/ {outputs}\n-PLAN.md ...\n\nAnyways concisely create this document with your findings, and the different priorities, ill go more in depth for the implementation of these later."
