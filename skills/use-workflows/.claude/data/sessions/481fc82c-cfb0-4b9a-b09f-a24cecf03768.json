    "are these valid issues that actually need fixing? if so fix them: \n\u2022 - Blocking \u2013 script timeout still non-portable (engine/script-\n    interpreter.sh:24-41): we still shell out to timeout, which isn\u2019t available\n    in the default macOS/Claude environment. Any script phase instantly fails\n    with \u201ccommand not found\u201d. Please guard the call (or switch to a Node-level\n    timeout) before moving forward.\n  - Blocking \u2013 phase object is still {} (engine/script-interpreter.sh:50-59): the\n    wrapper continues to define const phase = context.phases.current ? {} : {};,\n    so adaptive/gap-check scripts never receive phase metadata (phase.id, etc.).\n    That breaks every spec example that branches on phase attributes.\n  - Blocking \u2013 deliverable paths keep {{output_dir}} literals (engine/\n    subagent-pool.sh:138-168): templated output paths aren\u2019t run through\n    substitute_template_vars. The engine creates directories literally named\n    {{output_dir}}, which means later phases/gap checks can\u2019t find their outputs.\n  - Bug \u2013 prompt rendering still sees fabricated phase data (engine/subagent-\n    pool.sh:149-154): we\u2019re injecting a stub {id,name,description} instead of\n    the real phase JSON, so workflow-specific prompt templates can\u2019t access their\n    descriptions or behaviors.\n  - Bug \u2013 finalize_workflow references undefined workflow_path (engine/workflow-\n    runner.sh:268-281): within the helper the variable is out of scope, causing\n    template resolution to fail whenever the template isn\u2019t already absolute.\n  - Bug \u2013 metadata duration uses BSD-only date -j (engine/workflow-runner.sh:309-\n    320): on Linux this flag isn\u2019t recognized, so duration calculation fails.\n    Needs a cross-platform approach.",
    "rerun the tests we've previously created and @skills/use-workflows/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_V3.md . what's next to do ?",
    "get the tests fully working through fixing issues with our implementation or if its not an issue with implementation then u can fix the test",
    "\n  1. Update the remaining unit tests (template, script, context) to reflect the\n     new context schema and script runner\u2014then make sure they pass.\n  2. Align the integration test with the current runner semantics (context lives\n     in .temp/<feature>/context.json; metadata path is known).\n  3. Restore true parallelism once we have a locking strategy for context.json,\n     or explicitly scope Phase 1\u2019s \u201cparallel\u201d requirement to serialized MVP\n     behavior.\n  4. Wire the runner\u2019s CLI to accept flags cleanly (rename the current \u201cflags\u201d\n     array to actual options, avoid treating arbitrary strings as flags).\n  5. Track the outstanding \u201cauto-continue\u201d stubs for checkpoints/gap escalations\n     so we don\u2019t forget to replace them when introducing real user prompts."
