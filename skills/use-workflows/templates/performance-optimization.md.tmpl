# Performance Optimization Plan: {{feature.name}}

**Workflow:** Performance Optimization
**Execution Mode:** Adaptive

---

## Optimization Summary

Baseline-driven performance improvements with adaptive optimization strategy.

### Phases Completed

{{#phases.completed}}
- ✅ {{.}}
{{/phases.completed}}

## Baseline Measurements

See: `phase1-baseline/` for performance baseline and bottleneck analysis

## Optimization Strategy

The workflow adaptively selected optimizations based on baseline findings.

### Proposed Optimizations
See: `phase2-optimization/design.md`

### Implementation Plan
See: `phase4-implementation/sequence.md`

### Verification Strategy
See: `phase4-implementation/verification.md`

## Risk Assessment

See: `phase4-implementation/risks.json` for identified risks and mitigation strategies

## Next Steps

1. Review baseline metrics
2. Implement optimizations following sequence.md
3. Verify improvements using verification plan
4. Measure new baseline to confirm gains
