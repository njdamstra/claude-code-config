The Cloudflare Pages documentation provides an overview of the platform, which allows for the deployment of full-stack applications to the Cloudflare global network. You can deploy projects by connecting to a Git provider, uploading prebuilt assets directly, or using C3 from the command line[1].

Key features of Cloudflare Pages include:
*   **Pages Functions**: Deploy server-side code for dynamic functionality without a dedicated server[1].
*   **Rollbacks**: Instantly revert your project to a previous production deployment[1].
*   **Redirects**: Set up redirects for your project[1].

Related Cloudflare products that integrate with Pages include Workers (a serverless execution environment), R2 (object storage), D1 (serverless database), and Zaraz (for offloading third-party tools)[1]. The documentation also offers framework guides for popular frameworks like React, Hugo, and Next.js, and details about limits, such as 500 deploys per month on the Free plan[1].
