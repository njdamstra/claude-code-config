Cloudflare Workers is a serverless platform for building, deploying, and scaling applications across Cloudflare's global network. It allows developers to build full-stack applications using various frameworks like React, Vue, Svelte, Next, Astro, and React Router, and supports languages such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Rust[1].

Key features and benefits include:
*   **Performance and Reliability:** Delivers fast performance with high reliability globally[1].
*   **Framework Flexibility:** Supports popular web frameworks for front-end applications[1].
*   **Language Support:** Allows development in preferred languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and Rust[1].
*   **Deep Visibility:** Provides built-in observability with real-time logs and analytics[1].
*   **Cost-Effective:** Offers a free tier to get started and flexible pricing for growth[1].

Cloudflare Workers can be used for various applications, including front-end applications (deploying static assets to Cloudflare's CDN), back-end applications (building APIs and connecting to data stores), serverless AI inference (running LLMs and generating images), background jobs (scheduling cron jobs and running durable Workflows), and observability & monitoring[1].

It also integrates with various external services and data products through "Bindings," such as:
*   **Storage:** Durable Objects, D1 (serverless SQL), KV (key-value storage), Queues, Hyperdrive, R2 (object storage), and Vectorize (vector database)[1].
*   **Compute:** Workers AI (machine learning models), Workflows, and Browser Rendering[1].
*   **Media:** Cache/CDN and Images[1].
