## Summary of How to Use Astro

Astro is a modern web framework for building fast, content-focused websites. It's known for its unique "islands" architecture, which allows you to create interactive components that load independently, resulting in faster page loads and better performance.

This project uses Astro as its primary frontend framework, leveraging its capabilities for both static site generation (SSG) and server-side rendering (SSR). We also use Vue.js for creating interactive UI components.
