## [🗂️ LlamaIndex 🦙](https://console.groq.com/docs/llama-index\#-llamaindex-)

[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is a data framework for LLM-based applications that benefit from context augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. LlamaIndex provides the essential abstractions to more easily ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data, resulting in safe and reliable injection into LLMs for more accurate text generation.

For more information, read the LlamaIndex Groq integration documentation for [Python](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/llm/groq.html) and [JavaScript](https://ts.llamaindex.ai/modules/llms/available_llms/groq).
