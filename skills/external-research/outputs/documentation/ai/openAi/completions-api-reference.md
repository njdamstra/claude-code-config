## Legacy Status

The Completions endpoint (v1/completions) is marked as "legacy" in OpenAI's documentation. Most modern applications should use the Chat Completions API (v1/chat/completions) instead, which supports:
- More advanced models (GPT-4, GPT-4o, etc.)
- Conversation history
- System messages
- Function calling
- Better token efficiency
