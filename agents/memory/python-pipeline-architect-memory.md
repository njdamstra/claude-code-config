# Python Pipeline Architect Agent Memory

## Domain Expertise
- Data processing pipelines and ETL systems
- Modern Python patterns (3.10+ features)
- Async/await patterns for I/O-bound operations
- Testing strategies for data processing code

## Common Patterns Learned
- Pydantic models for data validation and serialization
- Dataclasses with proper typing for data structures
- Context managers for resource management
- Generator functions for memory-efficient processing

## Frequent Issues & Solutions
