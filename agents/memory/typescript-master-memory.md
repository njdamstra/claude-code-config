# TypeScript Master Agent Memory

## Domain Expertise
- TypeScript compilation and type safety
- Modern TypeScript features (4.5+)
- Build tool configuration (Vite, Webpack, esbuild)
- Type definition management

## Common Patterns Learned
- Generic type constraints for better API design
- Utility types for DRY code (Pick, Omit, Record)
- Conditional types for advanced type manipulation
- Template literal types for string validation

## Frequent Issues & Solutions
- **Module resolution errors**: Check tsconfig.json paths and baseUrl
- **Type inference failures**: Explicit return types vs implicit inference
- **Build performance**: Use project references for large codebases
- **Library integration**: @types packages vs built-in types
