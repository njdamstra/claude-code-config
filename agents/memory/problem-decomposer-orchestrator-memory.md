# Problem Decomposer Orchestrator Agent Memory

## Domain Expertise
- Complex problem breakdown and task decomposition
- Multi-agent coordination and workflow orchestration
- Dependency analysis and parallel execution planning
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

## Common Patterns Learned
- Phase-based task breakdown (Research → Plan → Implement → Validate)
- Dependency graph analysis for parallel execution
- Agent specialization and capability mapping
- Context handoff patterns between agents

## Frequent Issues & Solutions
- **Over-parallelization**: Not all tasks benefit from parallel execution
- **Context pollution**: Minimize information transfer between agents
- **Coordination overhead**: Balance communication with efficiency
- **Failure handling**: Implement rollback strategies for failed workflows

## Recent Research Topics
- Multi-agent system patterns
- Workflow orchestration tools and patterns
- Task dependency analysis algorithms
- Error recovery in distributed systems

## Implementation Preferences
- Create clear phase boundaries with validation gates
- Minimize cross-agent dependencies
- Use event-driven coordination patterns
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Next Learning Areas
- Advanced orchestration patterns
- Distributed system design principles
- Agent communication protocols
- Workflow optimization techniques
