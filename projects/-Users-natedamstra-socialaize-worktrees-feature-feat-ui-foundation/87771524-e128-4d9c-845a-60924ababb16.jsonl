Context is precious.\n\n**Always /clear when:**\n```bash\n# After completing any feature\ngit commit -m \"Add authentication system\"\n/clear\n\n# Before starting unrelated tasks\n/clear\n\"Now let's work on the email notification system\"\n\n# When switching between unrelated areas\n# Example: Frontend → Backend → DevOps\n/clear\n\"Switch to backend API development\"\n\n# When Claude seems confused or loops\n/clear\n\"Let's start fresh. Here's what I need...\"\n\n# Before visual regression tests (reset mental model)\n/clear\n/ui-visual-regression [component-path]\n```\n\n**Don't /clear when:**\n- Mid-feature implementation\n- Iterating on same component\n- Following multi-step plan\n- Claude is actively debugging\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If your next prompt is unrelated to the last 5 messages, /clear first.\n```\n\n### 1.2 Scratchpad System\n\n```markdown\n### Task Planning: .temp Folder\n\nFor complex multi-step tasks, externalize planning to save context for execution.\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```bash\n.temp/\n├── REFACTOR_PAD.md      # Current refactor planning\n├── DASHBOARD_PAD.md     # Dashboard feature planning\n├── MIGRATION_PAD.md     # Migration planning\n└── [TASK]_PAD.md        # Any task-specific scratchpad\n```\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n```bash\n# Start complex task\n\"Plan the provider pattern refactor in .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\"\n\n# Claude creates structured plan:\n## Task: Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n### Analysis\n- Current state: 57 duplicate platform components\n- What needs to change: Consolidate to BaseProviderCard + config\n- Potential issues: Testing, migration path\n\n### Plan\n1. Create BaseProviderCard component with slot system\n2. Create providers.ts configuration\n3. Migrate Facebook components (test)\n4. Migrate remaining platforms\n5. Remove deprecated files\n\n### Files to Modify\n- src/components/vue/base/BaseProviderCard.vue (NEW)\n- src/config/providers.ts (NEW)\n- src/components/vue/cards/FacebookCard.vue (REFACTOR)\n- [... 56 more files]\n\n### Validation\n- [ ] All platforms render correctly\n- [ ] Props pass through properly\n- [ ] Visual regression tests pass\n- [ ] Console errors clear\n\n# Review and approve\n\"Looks good, proceed with step 1\"\n\n# Claude executes step 1\n\n# Continue iteratively\n\"Show me what changed, then move to step 2\"\n\n# When complete, cleanup\nrm .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Planning is explicit and reviewable\n- Can pause/resume at any step\n- Context focused on execution, not planning\n- Can /clear between steps without losing plan\n- Works for ANY complex task\n\n**Examples across workflows:**\n```bash\n# Component refactor\n\"Plan the modal redesign in .temp/MODAL_PAD.md\"\n\n# Multi-file change\n\"Plan the authentication flow in .temp/AUTH_PAD.md\"\n\n# Migration\n\"Plan the Tailwind v4 upgrade in .temp/UPGRADE_PAD.md\"\n```\n```\n\n### 1.3 Persistent Decisions\n\n```markdown\n### Permanent Decisions: .claude/decisions.md\n\nFor architectural decisions that should persist across sessions.\n\n**Create:** `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**Only document:**\n- Technology choices (why X over Y)\n- Architecture patterns (why we structure things this way)\n- Breaking changes (what changed and why)\n- Failed approaches (so Claude doesn't retry them)\n\n**Format:**\n```markdown\n## [Decision Name] - [YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n**Context:** What prompted this decision\n**Decision:** What we decided to do\n**Reasoning:** Why we made this choice\n**Alternatives Considered:** What we didn't choose and why\n**Impact:** What this affects\n\n---\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Nanostore Over Pinia - 2025-10-15\n\n**Context:** Need global state management for user auth and theme\n\n**Decision:** Use Nanostore instead of Pinia\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Lighter weight (1kb vs 10kb)\n- Framework agnostic (works with Astro pages)\n- Simpler API for our use case\n- No Vue-specific coupling\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Pinia: Too heavy, Vue-specific\n- Vuex: Deprecated\n- Context/Provide: Doesn't work across Astro boundaries\n\n**Impact:** All global state uses Nanostore atoms\n\n---\n```\n\n**When to add:**\n- Once per major decision\n- Not for every component choice\n- Focus on \"why\" not \"what\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Part 2: Core Design Principles\n\n> **Location:** Add to `/CLAUDE.md` and update `design-system.css`  \n> **Benefit:** Professional UI quality, consistent visual language\n\n### 2.1 Depth Through Shadows (No Borders)\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 UI Design Principles\n\n### Depth Through Shadows & Color Layering\n\n**Problem:** Borders make UIs look flat and dated.\n\n**Solution:** Use shadows and color layering to create depth.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. Generate 3-4 shades for each base color\n2. Darker shades = background layers\n3. Lighter shades = foreground elements  \n4. Eliminate borders where possible\n5. Use dual-shadow system (light + dark)\n\n**Shadow System:**\n```css\n/* Three-tier shadow system */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);           /* Subtle elevation */\n--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),\n             0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);            /* Standard cards */\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n             0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);             /* Modals, popovers */\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15),\n             0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);           /* Hero sections */\n```\n\n**Tailwind pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Old: Borders -->\n<div class=\"border border-gray-300 rounded-lg\">\n\n<!-- ✅ New: Shadows + Color Layers -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 shadow-md rounded-lg\">\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg p-6\">\n    <!-- Content on lighter bg = elevated -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Color layering pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- Page → Section → Card → Content -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50\">              <!-- Darkest (page bg) -->\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-100 shadow-sm\">  <!-- Section bg -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white shadow-md\">   <!-- Card bg -->\n      <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-4\">     <!-- Elevated content -->\n        <!-- Lightest = highest elevation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**When borders ARE okay:**\n- Input fields (functional affordance)\n- Focus states (accessibility requirement)\n- Table cells (data separation)\n- Dividers (semantic separation)\n\n**Prompt pattern for Claude:**\n\"Use shadow-md and color layering (bg-gray-50/100) for depth. Avoid borders except for inputs and focus states.\"\n```\n\n### 2.2 Semantic Color Palette\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Semantic Color Palette System\n\n**Define 4 color types before any design work:**\n\n1. **Primary** — CTAs, key actions, brand identity\n2. **Secondary** — Subtle highlights, accents, secondary actions\n3. **Neutral** — Backgrounds, text, UI chrome (grays)\n4. **Semantic** — States (success, warning, error, info)\n\n**Token structure:**\n```css\n/* Primary (Brand) */\n--color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n--color-primary-500: #ef4444;   /* Base - buttons, links */\n--color-primary-600: #dc2626;   /* Hover state */\n--color-primary-700: #b91c1c;   /* Active state */\n--color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n\n/* Secondary (Accent) */\n--color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n--color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;  /* Base */\n--color-secondary-600: #0d9488;  /* Hover */\n\n/* Neutral (Grays) */\n--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;    /* Page background */\n--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;   /* Section background */\n--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;   /* Card background */\n--color-neutral-300: #d4d4d4;   /* Input borders */\n--color-neutral-400: #a3a3a3;   /* Disabled text */\n--color-neutral-500: #737373;   /* Secondary text */\n--color-neutral-700: #404040;   /* Body text */\n--color-neutral-900: #171717;   /* Headings */\n\n/* Semantic (States) */\n--color-success-50: #f0fdf4;\n--color-success-500: #22c55e;   /* Success messages */\n--color-warning-50: #fffbeb;\n--color-warning-500: #f59e0b;   /* Warning messages */\n--color-error-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-error-500: #ef4444;     /* Error messages */\n--color-info-50: #eff6ff;\n--color-info-500: #3b82f6;      /* Info messages */\n```\n\n**Usage rules:**\n- Primary: 1-2 uses per screen (CTAs only)\n- Secondary: Supporting actions, badges, highlights\n- Neutral: Everything else (80% of UI)\n- Semantic: State feedback only (not decoration)\n\n**Tailwind mapping:**\n```vue\n<!-- Primary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700\">\n\n<!-- Secondary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600\">\n\n<!-- Backgrounds (depth layering) -->\n<div class=\"bg-neutral-50\">        <!-- Page -->\n  <div class=\"bg-neutral-100\">     <!-- Section -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white\">         <!-- Card -->\n\n<!-- Semantic states -->\n<div class=\"bg-success-50 text-success-700 border border-success-200\">\n  ✓ Success message\n</div>\n```\n```\n\n### 2.3 Priority-Based Mobile Rearrangement\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Mobile-First: Priority Rearrangement\n\n**Problem:** Treating responsive as \"make it smaller\" produces bad mobile UX.\n\n**Solution:** Reorganize by priority on mobile, don't just shrink.\n\n**Priority system:**\n1. **Critical** — Primary action, key info (always visible)\n2. **Important** — Secondary actions, supporting content (visible but demoted)\n3. **Optional** — Tertiary features, extra info (collapsed/hidden)\n\n**Desktop vs Mobile structure:**\n```vue\n<!-- Desktop: Side-by-side layout -->\n<div class=\"lg:flex lg:gap-8\">\n  <aside class=\"lg:w-64\">\n    <!-- Filters, secondary nav -->\n  </aside>\n  <main class=\"lg:flex-1\">\n    <!-- Primary content -->\n  </main>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: Stacked by priority -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <!-- 1. Search/filter (critical - user intent) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <SearchBar />\n  </div>\n  \n  <!-- 2. Primary content (most important) -->\n  <main>\n    <ContentGrid />\n  </main>\n  \n  <!-- 3. Filters (collapsible - optional) -->\n  <details class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <summary>Filters</summary>\n    <FilterPanel />\n  </details>\n  \n  <!-- 4. Secondary nav (bottom sheet - tertiary) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden fixed bottom-0\">\n    <BottomNav />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Common mobile patterns:**\n```vue\n<!-- Pattern 1: Fixed bottom CTA (mobile) -->\n<button class=\"\n  md:static md:inline-flex\n  fixed bottom-4 left-4 right-4 w-auto\n  md:w-auto\n\">\n  Primary Action\n</button>\n\n<!-- Pattern 2: Horizontal scroll (mobile cards) -->\n<div class=\"\n  flex gap-4 overflow-x-auto md:grid md:grid-cols-3\n  snap-x snap-mandatory\n\">\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pattern 3: Collapsible sections (mobile) -->\n<div class=\"md:block hidden\">\n  <!-- Always visible on desktop -->\n</div>\n<details class=\"md:hidden\">\n  <summary class=\"font-medium cursor-pointer\">\n    Show Additional Info\n  </summary>\n  <div class=\"mt-4\">\n    <!-- Collapsed on mobile -->\n  </div>\n</details>\n```\n\n**Breakpoint strategy:**\n- `< 640px` (mobile): Single column, stacked by priority\n- `640-768px` (tablet): 2 columns or expanded single column\n- `> 768px` (desktop): Full layout with sidebars\n\n**Testing checklist:**\n- [ ] Critical actions visible without scrolling (mobile)\n- [ ] Content readable without zoom\n- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- [ ] No horizontal scroll (except intentional carousels)\n- [ ] Form inputs don't cause zoom on iOS\n```\n\n### 2.4 Update design-system.css\n\nAdd these tokens to `src/styles/design-system.css`:\n\n```css\n/* Add to design-system.css */\n\n/* ========================================\n   DEPTH SYSTEM (Shadows)\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Shadow scale */\n  --shadow-xs: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07),\n               0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),\n               0 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-2xl: 0 25px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  \n  /* Inner shadows for depth inversion */\n  --shadow-inner: inset 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n}\n\n/* ========================================\n   SEMANTIC COLOR PALETTE\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Primary (Brand/CTA) */\n  --color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n  --color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n  --color-primary-200: #fecaca;\n  --color-primary-300: #fca5a5;\n  --color-primary-400: #f87171;\n  --color-primary-500: #ef4444;\n  --color-primary-600: #dc2626;\n  --color-primary-700: #b91c1c;\n  --color-primary-800: #991b1b;\n  --color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n  \n  /* Secondary (Accent) */\n  --color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n  --color-secondary-100: #ccfbf1;\n  --color-secondary-200: #99f6e4;\n  --color-secondary-300: #5eead4;\n  --color-secondary-400: #2dd4bf;\n  --color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;\n  --color-secondary-600: #0d9488;\n  --color-secondary-700: #0f766e;\n  --color-secondary-800: #115e59;\n  --color-secondary-900: #134e4a;\n  \n  /* Neutral (Grays) -

Faster = more responsive feel.\n\n### Easing Functions\n\n```vue\n<!-- Ease Out (MOST COMMON) - Ending animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\">\n  <!-- Elements leaving, fading out, dropdown close -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In - Starting animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\">\n  <!-- Elements entering, fading in -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In-Out - Continuous motion -->\n<div class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out\">\n  <!-- Sliding panels, moving elements -->\n</div>\n```\n\n**Default:** Use `ease-out` for 90% of animations.\n\n### What to Animate\n\n**✅ Animate these (performant):**\n- `opacity` — Fades\n- `transform` — Move, scale, rotate\n- `max-height` — Accordions (with overflow-hidden)\n- `filter` — Blur, brightness (use sparingly)\n\n**❌ Don't animate these (causes reflow):**\n- `width`, `height` — Use `scale` instead\n- `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` — Use `transform: translate` instead\n- `padding`, `margin` — Causes layout shift\n\n### Common Animation Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Fade In/Out -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Content</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Down (Dropdown) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"isOpen\">Dropdown</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Scale In (Modal) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showModal\">Modal</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Up (Bottom Sheet) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n  leave-to-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showSheet\">Bottom Sheet</div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n### Accordion Pattern (Smooth Height)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst isOpen = ref(false)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"isOpen = !isOpen\">\n      Toggle Accordion\n    </button>\n    \n    <div\n      :class=\"[\n        'overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out',\n        isOpen ?

Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Spinning loader -->\n<div class=\"\n  w-8 h-8\n  border-4 border-neutral-200\n  border-t-primary-600\n  rounded-full\n  animate-spin\n\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pulsing loader (skeleton) -->\n<div class=\"\n  h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded\n  animate-pulse\n\">\n</div>\n```\n\n### Page Transition Pattern (Astro)\n\n```vue\n<!-- In Astro layout -->\n<div class=\"\n  animate-in fade-in duration-300\n\">\n  <slot />\n</div>\n```\n\n### Motion Preferences (Accessibility)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Respect prefers-reduced-motion -->\n<style>\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  * {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Animation Checklist\n\nWhen adding animations:\n- [ ] Duration is 150-300ms (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using `opacity` or `transform` (not width/height)\n- [ ] Easing is appropriate (ease-out for most)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show)\n```\n\n### 3.4 Spacing & Layout System\n\n```markdown\n## Spatial Rhythm System\n\n### Core Spacing Scale (Tailwind)\n\n**Use ONLY these values:** 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64\n\n**Avoid:** 5, 7, 10, 14, 20 (inconsistent, breaks rhythm)\n\n| Value | Pixels | Class | Use Case |\n|-------|--------|-------|----------|\n| 0.5 | 2px | `gap-0.5`, `p-0.5` | Micro spacing |\n| 1 | 4px | `gap-1`, `p-1` | Very tight |\n| 2 | 8px | `gap-2`, `p-2` | Tight groups (icon + text) |\n| 3 | 12px | `gap-3`, `p-3` | Compact spacing |\n| 4 | 16px | `gap-4`, `p-4` | Standard spacing (DEFAULT) |\n| 6 | 24px | `gap-6`, `p-6` | Comfortable spacing |\n| 8 | 32px | `gap-8`, `p-8` | Generous spacing |\n| 12 | 48px | `gap-12`, `p-12` | Section breaks |\n| 16 | 64px | `gap-16`, `p-16` | Major divisions |\n\n### Component Internal Spacing (gap)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Icon + Text (tight)

(justify) -->\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n  <h2>Title</h2>\n  <button>Action</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Container Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Page Container (max-width) -->\n<div class=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Section Container (breathing room) -->\n<section class=\"py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-24\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</section>\n\n<!-- Card Container -->\n<div class=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n  <!-- Centered card -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Spacing Decision Tree\n\n**Use `gap-2`:** Icon + text, tight button groups  \n**Use `gap-4`:** Form fields, related elements (DEFAULT)  \n**Use `gap-6`:** Card sections, distinct groups  \n**Use `gap-8`:** Major page sections  \n**Use `gap-12`+:** Hero sections, full-page breaks\n\n**Padding hierarchy:**  \n`p-4` → Mobile/compact  \n`p-6` → Standard (DEFAULT)  \n`p-8` → Spacious/desktop\n\n**Margin hierarchy:**  \n`mb-4` → Between elements  \n`mb-6` → Between groups  \n`mb-8` → Between sections  \n`mb-12`+ → Between major blocks\n```\n\n### 3.5 Icon System\n\n```markdown\n## Icon System Guidelines\n\n### Icon Library\n\n**Recommended:** Lucide Icons (clean,

</template>\n</Card>\n```\n\n### Scoped Slots (Data Passing)\n\n```vue\n<!-- DataList.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  items: Array<any>\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n    <div\n      v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n      :key=\"item.id\"\n    >\n      <slot :item=\"item\" :index=\"index\"

</template>\n</DataList>\n```\n\n### Fallback Content Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Alert.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.icon\" class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <slot name=\"icon\" />\n    </div>\n    <div v-else class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <!-- Default icon -->\n      <AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"alert-content\">\n      <slot>\n        <!-- Fallback if no content provided -->\n        <p>No message provided</p>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Conditional Slots Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Modal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useSlots } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst hasActions = computed(() => !!slots.actions)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div

When to Use Slots\n\n**Use slots when:**\n- ✅ Content structure varies significantly\n- ✅ Parent needs control over rendering\n- ✅ Building flexible, reusable components\n- ✅ Creating compound components (Card, Modal, Tabs)\n\n**Use props when:**\n- ✅ Data is simple (strings, numbers, booleans)\n- ✅ Component has fixed structure\n- ✅ Configuration over composition\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Part

Context is precious.\n\n**Always /clear when:**\n```bash\n# After completing any feature\ngit commit -m \"Add authentication system\"\n/clear\n\n# Before starting unrelated tasks\n/clear\n\"Now let's work on the email notification system\"\n\n# When switching between unrelated areas\n# Example: Frontend → Backend → DevOps\n/clear\n\"Switch to backend API development\"\n\n# When Claude seems confused or loops\n/clear\n\"Let's start fresh. Here's what I need...\"\n\n# Before visual regression tests (reset mental model)\n/clear\n/ui-visual-regression [component-path]\n```\n\n**Don't /clear when:**\n- Mid-feature implementation\n- Iterating on same component\n- Following multi-step plan\n- Claude is actively debugging\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If your next prompt is unrelated to the last 5 messages, /clear first.\n```\n\n### 1.2 Scratchpad System\n\n```markdown\n### Task Planning: .temp Folder\n\nFor complex multi-step tasks, externalize planning to save context for execution.\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```bash\n.temp/\n├── REFACTOR_PAD.md      # Current refactor planning\n├── DASHBOARD_PAD.md     # Dashboard feature planning\n├── MIGRATION_PAD.md     # Migration planning\n└── [TASK]_PAD.md        # Any task-specific scratchpad\n```\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n```bash\n# Start complex task\n\"Plan the provider pattern refactor in .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\"\n\n# Claude creates structured plan:\n## Task: Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n### Analysis\n- Current state: 57 duplicate platform components\n- What needs to change: Consolidate to BaseProviderCard + config\n- Potential issues: Testing, migration path\n\n### Plan\n1. Create BaseProviderCard component with slot system\n2. Create providers.ts configuration\n3. Migrate Facebook components (test)\n4. Migrate remaining platforms\n5. Remove deprecated files\n\n### Files to Modify\n- src/components/vue/base/BaseProviderCard.vue (NEW)\n- src/config/providers.ts (NEW)\n- src/components/vue/cards/FacebookCard.vue (REFACTOR)\n- [... 56 more files]\n\n### Validation\n- [ ] All platforms render correctly\n- [ ] Props pass through properly\n- [ ] Visual regression tests pass\n- [ ] Console errors clear\n\n# Review and approve\n\"Looks good, proceed with step 1\"\n\n# Claude executes step 1\n\n# Continue iteratively\n\"Show me what changed, then move to step 2\"\n\n# When complete, cleanup\nrm .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Planning is explicit and reviewable\n- Can pause/resume at any step\n- Context focused on execution, not planning\n- Can /clear between steps without losing plan\n- Works for ANY complex task\n\n**Examples across workflows:**\n```bash\n# Component refactor\n\"Plan the modal redesign in .temp/MODAL_PAD.md\"\n\n# Multi-file change\n\"Plan the authentication flow in .temp/AUTH_PAD.md\"\n\n# Migration\n\"Plan the Tailwind v4 upgrade in .temp/UPGRADE_PAD.md\"\n```\n```\n\n### 1.3 Persistent Decisions\n\n```markdown\n### Permanent Decisions: .claude/decisions.md\n\nFor architectural decisions that should persist across sessions.\n\n**Create:** `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**Only document:**\n- Technology choices (why X over Y)\n- Architecture patterns (why we structure things this way)\n- Breaking changes (what changed and why)\n- Failed approaches (so Claude doesn't retry them)\n\n**Format:**\n```markdown\n## [Decision Name] - [YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n**Context:** What prompted this decision\n**Decision:** What we decided to do\n**Reasoning:** Why we made this choice\n**Alternatives Considered:** What we didn't choose and why\n**Impact:** What this affects\n\n---\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Nanostore Over Pinia - 2025-10-15\n\n**Context:** Need global state management for user auth and theme\n\n**Decision:** Use Nanostore instead of Pinia\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Lighter weight (1kb vs 10kb)\n- Framework agnostic (works with Astro pages)\n- Simpler API for our use case\n- No Vue-specific coupling\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Pinia: Too heavy, Vue-specific\n- Vuex: Deprecated\n- Context/Provide: Doesn't work across Astro boundaries\n\n**Impact:** All global state uses Nanostore atoms\n\n---\n```\n\n**When to add:**\n- Once per major decision\n- Not for every component choice\n- Focus on \"why\" not \"what\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Part 2: Core Design Principles\n\n> **Location:** Add to `/CLAUDE.md` and update `design-system.css`  \n> **Benefit:** Professional UI quality, consistent visual language\n\n### 2.1 Depth Through Shadows (No Borders)\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 UI Design Principles\n\n### Depth Through Shadows & Color Layering\n\n**Problem:** Borders make UIs look flat and dated.\n\n**Solution:** Use shadows and color layering to create depth.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. Generate 3-4 shades for each base color\n2. Darker shades = background layers\n3. Lighter shades = foreground elements  \n4. Eliminate borders where possible\n5. Use dual-shadow system (light + dark)\n\n**Shadow System:**\n```css\n/* Three-tier shadow system */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);           /* Subtle elevation */\n--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),\n             0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);            /* Standard cards */\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n             0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);             /* Modals, popovers */\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15),\n             0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);           /* Hero sections */\n```\n\n**Tailwind pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Old: Borders -->\n<div class=\"border border-gray-300 rounded-lg\">\n\n<!-- ✅ New: Shadows + Color Layers -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 shadow-md rounded-lg\">\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg p-6\">\n    <!-- Content on lighter bg = elevated -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Color layering pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- Page → Section → Card → Content -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50\">              <!-- Darkest (page bg) -->\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-100 shadow-sm\">  <!-- Section bg -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white shadow-md\">   <!-- Card bg -->\n      <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-4\">     <!-- Elevated content -->\n        <!-- Lightest = highest elevation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**When borders ARE okay:**\n- Input fields (functional affordance)\n- Focus states (accessibility requirement)\n- Table cells (data separation)\n- Dividers (semantic separation)\n\n**Prompt pattern for Claude:**\n\"Use shadow-md and color layering (bg-gray-50/100) for depth. Avoid borders except for inputs and focus states.\"\n```\n\n### 2.2 Semantic Color Palette\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Semantic Color Palette System\n\n**Define 4 color types before any design work:**\n\n1. **Primary** — CTAs, key actions, brand identity\n2. **Secondary** — Subtle highlights, accents, secondary actions\n3. **Neutral** — Backgrounds, text, UI chrome (grays)\n4. **Semantic** — States (success, warning, error, info)\n\n**Token structure:**\n```css\n/* Primary (Brand) */\n--color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n--color-primary-500: #ef4444;   /* Base - buttons, links */\n--color-primary-600: #dc2626;   /* Hover state */\n--color-primary-700: #b91c1c;   /* Active state */\n--color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n\n/* Secondary (Accent) */\n--color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n--color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;  /* Base */\n--color-secondary-600: #0d9488;  /* Hover */\n\n/* Neutral (Grays) */\n--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;    /* Page background */\n--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;   /* Section background */\n--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;   /* Card background */\n--color-neutral-300: #d4d4d4;   /* Input borders */\n--color-neutral-400: #a3a3a3;   /* Disabled text */\n--color-neutral-500: #737373;   /* Secondary text */\n--color-neutral-700: #404040;   /* Body text */\n--color-neutral-900: #171717;   /* Headings */\n\n/* Semantic (States) */\n--color-success-50: #f0fdf4;\n--color-success-500: #22c55e;   /* Success messages */\n--color-warning-50: #fffbeb;\n--color-warning-500: #f59e0b;   /* Warning messages */\n--color-error-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-error-500: #ef4444;     /* Error messages */\n--color-info-50: #eff6ff;\n--color-info-500: #3b82f6;      /* Info messages */\n```\n\n**Usage rules:**\n- Primary: 1-2 uses per screen (CTAs only)\n- Secondary: Supporting actions, badges, highlights\n- Neutral: Everything else (80% of UI)\n- Semantic: State feedback only (not decoration)\n\n**Tailwind mapping:**\n```vue\n<!-- Primary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700\">\n\n<!-- Secondary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600\">\n\n<!-- Backgrounds (depth layering) -->\n<div class=\"bg-neutral-50\">        <!-- Page -->\n  <div class=\"bg-neutral-100\">     <!-- Section -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white\">         <!-- Card -->\n\n<!-- Semantic states -->\n<div class=\"bg-success-50 text-success-700 border border-success-200\">\n  ✓ Success message\n</div>\n```\n```\n\n### 2.3 Priority-Based Mobile Rearrangement\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Mobile-First: Priority Rearrangement\n\n**Problem:** Treating responsive as \"make it smaller\" produces bad mobile UX.\n\n**Solution:** Reorganize by priority on mobile, don't just shrink.\n\n**Priority system:**\n1. **Critical** — Primary action, key info (always visible)\n2. **Important** — Secondary actions, supporting content (visible but demoted)\n3. **Optional** — Tertiary features, extra info (collapsed/hidden)\n\n**Desktop vs Mobile structure:**\n```vue\n<!-- Desktop: Side-by-side layout -->\n<div class=\"lg:flex lg:gap-8\">\n  <aside class=\"lg:w-64\">\n    <!-- Filters, secondary nav -->\n  </aside>\n  <main class=\"lg:flex-1\">\n    <!-- Primary content -->\n  </main>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: Stacked by priority -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <!-- 1. Search/filter (critical - user intent) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <SearchBar />\n  </div>\n  \n  <!-- 2. Primary content (most important) -->\n  <main>\n    <ContentGrid />\n  </main>\n  \n  <!-- 3. Filters (collapsible - optional) -->\n  <details class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <summary>Filters</summary>\n    <FilterPanel />\n  </details>\n  \n  <!-- 4. Secondary nav (bottom sheet - tertiary) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden fixed bottom-0\">\n    <BottomNav />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Common mobile patterns:**\n```vue\n<!-- Pattern 1: Fixed bottom CTA (mobile) -->\n<button class=\"\n  md:static md:inline-flex\n  fixed bottom-4 left-4 right-4 w-auto\n  md:w-auto\n\">\n  Primary Action\n</button>\n\n<!-- Pattern 2: Horizontal scroll (mobile cards) -->\n<div class=\"\n  flex gap-4 overflow-x-auto md:grid md:grid-cols-3\n  snap-x snap-mandatory\n\">\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pattern 3: Collapsible sections (mobile) -->\n<div class=\"md:block hidden\">\n  <!-- Always visible on desktop -->\n</div>\n<details class=\"md:hidden\">\n  <summary class=\"font-medium cursor-pointer\">\n    Show Additional Info\n  </summary>\n  <div class=\"mt-4\">\n    <!-- Collapsed on mobile -->\n  </div>\n</details>\n```\n\n**Breakpoint strategy:**\n- `< 640px` (mobile): Single column, stacked by priority\n- `640-768px` (tablet): 2 columns or expanded single column\n- `> 768px` (desktop): Full layout with sidebars\n\n**Testing checklist:**\n- [ ] Critical actions visible without scrolling (mobile)\n- [ ] Content readable without zoom\n- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- [ ] No horizontal scroll (except intentional carousels)\n- [ ] Form inputs don't cause zoom on iOS\n```\n\n### 2.4 Update design-system.css\n\nAdd these tokens to `src/styles/design-system.css`:\n\n```css\n/* Add to design-system.css */\n\n/* ========================================\n   DEPTH SYSTEM (Shadows)\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Shadow scale */\n  --shadow-xs: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07),\n               0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),\n               0 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-2xl: 0 25px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  \n  /* Inner shadows for depth inversion */\n  --shadow-inner: inset 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n}\n\n/* ========================================\n   SEMANTIC COLOR PALETTE\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Primary (Brand/CTA) */\n  --color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n  --color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n  --color-primary-200: #fecaca;\n  --color-primary-300: #fca5a5;\n  --color-primary-400: #f87171;\n  --color-primary-500: #ef4444;\n  --color-primary-600: #dc2626;\n  --color-primary-700: #b91c1c;\n  --color-primary-800: #991b1b;\n  --color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n  \n  /* Secondary (Accent) */\n  --color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n  --color-secondary-100: #ccfbf1;\n  --color-secondary-200: #99f6e4;\n  --color-secondary-300: #5eead4;\n  --color-secondary-400: #2dd4bf;\n  --color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;\n  --color-secondary-600: #0d9488;\n  --color-secondary-700: #0f766e;\n  --color-secondary-800: #115e59;\n  --color-secondary-900: #134e4a;\n  \n  /* Neutral (Grays) -

Faster = more responsive feel.\n\n### Easing Functions\n\n```vue\n<!-- Ease Out (MOST COMMON) - Ending animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\">\n  <!-- Elements leaving, fading out, dropdown close -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In - Starting animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\">\n  <!-- Elements entering, fading in -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In-Out - Continuous motion -->\n<div class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out\">\n  <!-- Sliding panels, moving elements -->\n</div>\n```\n\n**Default:** Use `ease-out` for 90% of animations.\n\n### What to Animate\n\n**✅ Animate these (performant):**\n- `opacity` — Fades\n- `transform` — Move, scale, rotate\n- `max-height` — Accordions (with overflow-hidden)\n- `filter` — Blur, brightness (use sparingly)\n\n**❌ Don't animate these (causes reflow):**\n- `width`, `height` — Use `scale` instead\n- `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` — Use `transform: translate` instead\n- `padding`, `margin` — Causes layout shift\n\n### Common Animation Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Fade In/Out -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Content</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Down (Dropdown) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"isOpen\">Dropdown</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Scale In (Modal) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showModal\">Modal</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Up (Bottom Sheet) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n  leave-to-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showSheet\">Bottom Sheet</div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n### Accordion Pattern (Smooth Height)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst isOpen = ref(false)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"isOpen = !isOpen\">\n      Toggle Accordion\n    </button>\n    \n    <div\n      :class=\"[\n        'overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out',\n        isOpen ?

Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Spinning loader -->\n<div class=\"\n  w-8 h-8\n  border-4 border-neutral-200\n  border-t-primary-600\n  rounded-full\n  animate-spin\n\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pulsing loader (skeleton) -->\n<div class=\"\n  h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded\n  animate-pulse\n\">\n</div>\n```\n\n### Page Transition Pattern (Astro)\n\n```vue\n<!-- In Astro layout -->\n<div class=\"\n  animate-in fade-in duration-300\n\">\n  <slot />\n</div>\n```\n\n### Motion Preferences (Accessibility)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Respect prefers-reduced-motion -->\n<style>\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  * {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Animation Checklist\n\nWhen adding animations:\n- [ ] Duration is 150-300ms (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using `opacity` or `transform` (not width/height)\n- [ ] Easing is appropriate (ease-out for most)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show)\n```\n\n### 3.4 Spacing & Layout System\n\n```markdown\n## Spatial Rhythm System\n\n### Core Spacing Scale (Tailwind)\n\n**Use ONLY these values:** 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64\n\n**Avoid:** 5, 7, 10, 14, 20 (inconsistent, breaks rhythm)\n\n| Value | Pixels | Class | Use Case |\n|-------|--------|-------|----------|\n| 0.5 | 2px | `gap-0.5`, `p-0.5` | Micro spacing |\n| 1 | 4px | `gap-1`, `p-1` | Very tight |\n| 2 | 8px | `gap-2`, `p-2` | Tight groups (icon + text) |\n| 3 | 12px | `gap-3`, `p-3` | Compact spacing |\n| 4 | 16px | `gap-4`, `p-4` | Standard spacing (DEFAULT) |\n| 6 | 24px | `gap-6`, `p-6` | Comfortable spacing |\n| 8 | 32px | `gap-8`, `p-8` | Generous spacing |\n| 12 | 48px | `gap-12`, `p-12` | Section breaks |\n| 16 | 64px | `gap-16`, `p-16` | Major divisions |\n\n### Component Internal Spacing (gap)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Icon + Text (tight)

(justify) -->\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n  <h2>Title</h2>\n  <button>Action</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Container Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Page Container (max-width) -->\n<div class=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Section Container (breathing room) -->\n<section class=\"py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-24\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</section>\n\n<!-- Card Container -->\n<div class=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n  <!-- Centered card -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Spacing Decision Tree\n\n**Use `gap-2`:** Icon + text, tight button groups  \n**Use `gap-4`:** Form fields, related elements (DEFAULT)  \n**Use `gap-6`:** Card sections, distinct groups  \n**Use `gap-8`:** Major page sections  \n**Use `gap-12`+:** Hero sections, full-page breaks\n\n**Padding hierarchy:**  \n`p-4` → Mobile/compact  \n`p-6` → Standard (DEFAULT)  \n`p-8` → Spacious/desktop\n\n**Margin hierarchy:**  \n`mb-4` → Between elements  \n`mb-6` → Between groups  \n`mb-8` → Between sections  \n`mb-12`+ → Between major blocks\n```\n\n### 3.5 Icon System\n\n```markdown\n## Icon System Guidelines\n\n### Icon Library\n\n**Recommended:** Lucide Icons (clean,

</template>\n</Card>\n```\n\n### Scoped Slots (Data Passing)\n\n```vue\n<!-- DataList.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  items: Array<any>\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n    <div\n      v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n      :key=\"item.id\"\n    >\n      <slot :item=\"item\" :index=\"index\"

</template>\n</DataList>\n```\n\n### Fallback Content Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Alert.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.icon\" class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <slot name=\"icon\" />\n    </div>\n    <div v-else class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <!-- Default icon -->\n      <AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"alert-content\">\n      <slot>\n        <!-- Fallback if no content provided -->\n        <p>No message provided</p>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Conditional Slots Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Modal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useSlots } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst hasActions = computed(() => !!slots.actions)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div

When to Use Slots\n\n**Use slots when:**\n- ✅ Content structure varies significantly\n- ✅ Parent needs control over rendering\n- ✅ Building flexible, reusable components\n- ✅ Creating compound components (Card, Modal, Tabs)\n\n**Use props when:**\n- ✅ Data is simple (strings, numbers, booleans)\n- ✅ Component has fixed structure\n- ✅ Configuration over composition\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Part

[Reuse existing component X]\n2. [Add tokens: --color-{name}]\n3. [Refactor to provider pattern]\n```\n\n## Design System Rules\n\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n✅ Tailwind utility classes only\n✅ Computed classes for dynamic styling\n✅ Semantic token names (--color-primary, not --color-blue)\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb values\n❌ Inline style attributes\n❌ @apply directives\n❌ Custom px values not in design system\n\n## Token Naming Conventions\n\nFollow these patterns:\n- Colors: `--color-{semantic}-{shade}` (e.g., --color-primary-500)\n- Spacing: Use Tailwind scale (--spacing-4, --spacing-8)\n- Typography: `--font-{family}`, `--text-{size}`\n- Shadows: `--shadow-{size}`\n- Borders: `--border-{size}`\n- Radii: `--radius-{size}`\n\n## Search Strategy\n\n### Before Creating New Components:\n1. Search by functionality: `grep -r \"Button\" src/components/vue/`\n2. Search by pattern: `grep -r \"class.*btn\" src/components/vue/`\n3. Check ui/ and base/ directories first\n4. Look for provider patterns in config/\n\n### Composition Over Creation:\n- **Priority 1**: Reuse existing component\n- **Priority 2**: Compose from multiple components  \n- **Priority 3**: Extend base component\n- **Priority 4**: Create new only if justified\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- Limit initial context gathering to relevant files only\n- Use specific grep patterns for targeted searches\n- Focus on the most relevant 10-15 components\n- Don't read entire component directory at once\n\n## Communication Style\n\n- Be concise and actionable\n- Provide file paths for all references\n- Use bullet points for clarity\n- Include code examples when helpful\n- Flag critical issues immediately\n\n## Integration with Other Agents\n\n- **Feed to ui-builder**: Design tokens and patterns found\n- **Feed to ui-validator**: Compliance issues to check\n- **Feed to ui-documenter**: Token documentation needs\n\nYou work proactively - when you see requests for new components, AUTOMATICALLY analyze first before any code is written.","numLines":147,"startLine":1,"totalLines":147}}}

Context is precious.\n\n**Always /clear when:**\n```bash\n# After completing any feature\ngit commit -m \"Add authentication system\"\n/clear\n\n# Before starting unrelated tasks\n/clear\n\"Now let's work on the email notification system\"\n\n# When switching between unrelated areas\n# Example: Frontend → Backend → DevOps\n/clear\n\"Switch to backend API development\"\n\n# When Claude seems confused or loops\n/clear\n\"Let's start fresh. Here's what I need...\"\n\n# Before visual regression tests (reset mental model)\n/clear\n/ui-visual-regression [component-path]\n```\n\n**Don't /clear when:**\n- Mid-feature implementation\n- Iterating on same component\n- Following multi-step plan\n- Claude is actively debugging\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If your next prompt is unrelated to the last 5 messages, /clear first.\n```\n\n### 1.2 Scratchpad System\n\n```markdown\n### Task Planning: .temp Folder\n\nFor complex multi-step tasks, externalize planning to save context for execution.\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```bash\n.temp/\n├── REFACTOR_PAD.md      # Current refactor planning\n├── DASHBOARD_PAD.md     # Dashboard feature planning\n├── MIGRATION_PAD.md     # Migration planning\n└── [TASK]_PAD.md        # Any task-specific scratchpad\n```\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n```bash\n# Start complex task\n\"Plan the provider pattern refactor in .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\"\n\n# Claude creates structured plan:\n## Task: Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n### Analysis\n- Current state: 57 duplicate platform components\n- What needs to change: Consolidate to BaseProviderCard + config\n- Potential issues: Testing, migration path\n\n### Plan\n1. Create BaseProviderCard component with slot system\n2. Create providers.ts configuration\n3. Migrate Facebook components (test)\n4. Migrate remaining platforms\n5. Remove deprecated files\n\n### Files to Modify\n- src/components/vue/base/BaseProviderCard.vue (NEW)\n- src/config/providers.ts (NEW)\n- src/components/vue/cards/FacebookCard.vue (REFACTOR)\n- [... 56 more files]\n\n### Validation\n- [ ] All platforms render correctly\n- [ ] Props pass through properly\n- [ ] Visual regression tests pass\n- [ ] Console errors clear\n\n# Review and approve\n\"Looks good, proceed with step 1\"\n\n# Claude executes step 1\n\n# Continue iteratively\n\"Show me what changed, then move to step 2\"\n\n# When complete, cleanup\nrm .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Planning is explicit and reviewable\n- Can pause/resume at any step\n- Context focused on execution, not planning\n- Can /clear between steps without losing plan\n- Works for ANY complex task\n\n**Examples across workflows:**\n```bash\n# Component refactor\n\"Plan the modal redesign in .temp/MODAL_PAD.md\"\n\n# Multi-file change\n\"Plan the authentication flow in .temp/AUTH_PAD.md\"\n\n# Migration\n\"Plan the Tailwind v4 upgrade in .temp/UPGRADE_PAD.md\"\n```\n```\n\n### 1.3 Persistent Decisions\n\n```markdown\n### Permanent Decisions: .claude/decisions.md\n\nFor architectural decisions that should persist across sessions.\n\n**Create:** `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**Only document:**\n- Technology choices (why X over Y)\n- Architecture patterns (why we structure things this way)\n- Breaking changes (what changed and why)\n- Failed approaches (so Claude doesn't retry them)\n\n**Format:**\n```markdown\n## [Decision Name] - [YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n**Context:** What prompted this decision\n**Decision:** What we decided to do\n**Reasoning:** Why we made this choice\n**Alternatives Considered:** What we didn't choose and why\n**Impact:** What this affects\n\n---\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Nanostore Over Pinia - 2025-10-15\n\n**Context:** Need global state management for user auth and theme\n\n**Decision:** Use Nanostore instead of Pinia\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Lighter weight (1kb vs 10kb)\n- Framework agnostic (works with Astro pages)\n- Simpler API for our use case\n- No Vue-specific coupling\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Pinia: Too heavy, Vue-specific\n- Vuex: Deprecated\n- Context/Provide: Doesn't work across Astro boundaries\n\n**Impact:** All global state uses Nanostore atoms\n\n---\n```\n\n**When to add:**\n- Once per major decision\n- Not for every component choice\n- Focus on \"why\" not \"what\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Part 2: Core Design Principles\n\n> **Location:** Add to `/CLAUDE.md` and update `design-system.css`  \n> **Benefit:** Professional UI quality, consistent visual language\n\n### 2.1 Depth Through Shadows (No Borders)\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 UI Design Principles\n\n### Depth Through Shadows & Color Layering\n\n**Problem:** Borders make UIs look flat and dated.\n\n**Solution:** Use shadows and color layering to create depth.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. Generate 3-4 shades for each base color\n2. Darker shades = background layers\n3. Lighter shades = foreground elements  \n4. Eliminate borders where possible\n5. Use dual-shadow system (light + dark)\n\n**Shadow System:**\n```css\n/* Three-tier shadow system */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);           /* Subtle elevation */\n--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),\n             0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);            /* Standard cards */\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n             0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);             /* Modals, popovers */\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15),\n             0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);           /* Hero sections */\n```\n\n**Tailwind pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Old: Borders -->\n<div class=\"border border-gray-300 rounded-lg\">\n\n<!-- ✅ New: Shadows + Color Layers -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 shadow-md rounded-lg\">\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg p-6\">\n    <!-- Content on lighter bg = elevated -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Color layering pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- Page → Section → Card → Content -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50\">              <!-- Darkest (page bg) -->\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-100 shadow-sm\">  <!-- Section bg -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white shadow-md\">   <!-- Card bg -->\n      <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-4\">     <!-- Elevated content -->\n        <!-- Lightest = highest elevation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**When borders ARE okay:**\n- Input fields (functional affordance)\n- Focus states (accessibility requirement)\n- Table cells (data separation)\n- Dividers (semantic separation)\n\n**Prompt pattern for Claude:**\n\"Use shadow-md and color layering (bg-gray-50/100) for depth. Avoid borders except for inputs and focus states.\"\n```\n\n### 2.2 Semantic Color Palette\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Semantic Color Palette System\n\n**Define 4 color types before any design work:**\n\n1. **Primary** — CTAs, key actions, brand identity\n2. **Secondary** — Subtle highlights, accents, secondary actions\n3. **Neutral** — Backgrounds, text, UI chrome (grays)\n4. **Semantic** — States (success, warning, error, info)\n\n**Token structure:**\n```css\n/* Primary (Brand) */\n--color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n--color-primary-500: #ef4444;   /* Base - buttons, links */\n--color-primary-600: #dc2626;   /* Hover state */\n--color-primary-700: #b91c1c;   /* Active state */\n--color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n\n/* Secondary (Accent) */\n--color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n--color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;  /* Base */\n--color-secondary-600: #0d9488;  /* Hover */\n\n/* Neutral (Grays) */\n--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;    /* Page background */\n--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;   /* Section background */\n--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;   /* Card background */\n--color-neutral-300: #d4d4d4;   /* Input borders */\n--color-neutral-400: #a3a3a3;   /* Disabled text */\n--color-neutral-500: #737373;   /* Secondary text */\n--color-neutral-700: #404040;   /* Body text */\n--color-neutral-900: #171717;   /* Headings */\n\n/* Semantic (States) */\n--color-success-50: #f0fdf4;\n--color-success-500: #22c55e;   /* Success messages */\n--color-warning-50: #fffbeb;\n--color-warning-500: #f59e0b;   /* Warning messages */\n--color-error-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-error-500: #ef4444;     /* Error messages */\n--color-info-50: #eff6ff;\n--color-info-500: #3b82f6;      /* Info messages */\n```\n\n**Usage rules:**\n- Primary: 1-2 uses per screen (CTAs only)\n- Secondary: Supporting actions, badges, highlights\n- Neutral: Everything else (80% of UI)\n- Semantic: State feedback only (not decoration)\n\n**Tailwind mapping:**\n```vue\n<!-- Primary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700\">\n\n<!-- Secondary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600\">\n\n<!-- Backgrounds (depth layering) -->\n<div class=\"bg-neutral-50\">        <!-- Page -->\n  <div class=\"bg-neutral-100\">     <!-- Section -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white\">         <!-- Card -->\n\n<!-- Semantic states -->\n<div class=\"bg-success-50 text-success-700 border border-success-200\">\n  ✓ Success message\n</div>\n```\n```\n\n### 2.3 Priority-Based Mobile Rearrangement\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Mobile-First: Priority Rearrangement\n\n**Problem:** Treating responsive as \"make it smaller\" produces bad mobile UX.\n\n**Solution:** Reorganize by priority on mobile, don't just shrink.\n\n**Priority system:**\n1. **Critical** — Primary action, key info (always visible)\n2. **Important** — Secondary actions, supporting content (visible but demoted)\n3. **Optional** — Tertiary features, extra info (collapsed/hidden)\n\n**Desktop vs Mobile structure:**\n```vue\n<!-- Desktop: Side-by-side layout -->\n<div class=\"lg:flex lg:gap-8\">\n  <aside class=\"lg:w-64\">\n    <!-- Filters, secondary nav -->\n  </aside>\n  <main class=\"lg:flex-1\">\n    <!-- Primary content -->\n  </main>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: Stacked by priority -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <!-- 1. Search/filter (critical - user intent) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <SearchBar />\n  </div>\n  \n  <!-- 2. Primary content (most important) -->\n  <main>\n    <ContentGrid />\n  </main>\n  \n  <!-- 3. Filters (collapsible - optional) -->\n  <details class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <summary>Filters</summary>\n    <FilterPanel />\n  </details>\n  \n  <!-- 4. Secondary nav (bottom sheet - tertiary) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden fixed bottom-0\">\n    <BottomNav />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Common mobile patterns:**\n```vue\n<!-- Pattern 1: Fixed bottom CTA (mobile) -->\n<button class=\"\n  md:static md:inline-flex\n  fixed bottom-4 left-4 right-4 w-auto\n  md:w-auto\n\">\n  Primary Action\n</button>\n\n<!-- Pattern 2: Horizontal scroll (mobile cards) -->\n<div class=\"\n  flex gap-4 overflow-x-auto md:grid md:grid-cols-3\n  snap-x snap-mandatory\n\">\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pattern 3: Collapsible sections (mobile) -->\n<div class=\"md:block hidden\">\n  <!-- Always visible on desktop -->\n</div>\n<details class=\"md:hidden\">\n  <summary class=\"font-medium cursor-pointer\">\n    Show Additional Info\n  </summary>\n  <div class=\"mt-4\">\n    <!-- Collapsed on mobile -->\n  </div>\n</details>\n```\n\n**Breakpoint strategy:**\n- `< 640px` (mobile): Single column, stacked by priority\n- `640-768px` (tablet): 2 columns or expanded single column\n- `> 768px` (desktop): Full layout with sidebars\n\n**Testing checklist:**\n- [ ] Critical actions visible without scrolling (mobile)\n- [ ] Content readable without zoom\n- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- [ ] No horizontal scroll (except intentional carousels)\n- [ ] Form inputs don't cause zoom on iOS\n```\n\n### 2.4 Update design-system.css\n\nAdd these tokens to `src/styles/design-system.css`:\n\n```css\n/* Add to design-system.css */\n\n/* ========================================\n   DEPTH SYSTEM (Shadows)\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Shadow scale */\n  --shadow-xs: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07),\n               0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),\n               0 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-2xl: 0 25px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  \n  /* Inner shadows for depth inversion */\n  --shadow-inner: inset 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n}\n\n/* ========================================\n   SEMANTIC COLOR PALETTE\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Primary (Brand/CTA) */\n  --color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n  --color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n  --color-primary-200: #fecaca;\n  --color-primary-300: #fca5a5;\n  --color-primary-400: #f87171;\n  --color-primary-500: #ef4444;\n  --color-primary-600: #dc2626;\n  --color-primary-700: #b91c1c;\n  --color-primary-800: #991b1b;\n  --color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n  \n  /* Secondary (Accent) */\n  --color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n  --color-secondary-100: #ccfbf1;\n  --color-secondary-200: #99f6e4;\n  --color-secondary-300: #5eead4;\n  --color-secondary-400: #2dd4bf;\n  --color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;\n  --color-secondary-600: #0d9488;\n  --color-secondary-700: #0f766e;\n  --color-secondary-800: #115e59;\n  --color-secondary-900: #134e4a;\n  \n  /* Neutral (Grays) -

Faster = more responsive feel.\n\n### Easing Functions\n\n```vue\n<!-- Ease Out (MOST COMMON) - Ending animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\">\n  <!-- Elements leaving, fading out, dropdown close -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In - Starting animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\">\n  <!-- Elements entering, fading in -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In-Out - Continuous motion -->\n<div class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out\">\n  <!-- Sliding panels, moving elements -->\n</div>\n```\n\n**Default:** Use `ease-out` for 90% of animations.\n\n### What to Animate\n\n**✅ Animate these (performant):**\n- `opacity` — Fades\n- `transform` — Move, scale, rotate\n- `max-height` — Accordions (with overflow-hidden)\n- `filter` — Blur, brightness (use sparingly)\n\n**❌ Don't animate these (causes reflow):**\n- `width`, `height` — Use `scale` instead\n- `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` — Use `transform: translate` instead\n- `padding`, `margin` — Causes layout shift\n\n### Common Animation Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Fade In/Out -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Content</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Down (Dropdown) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"isOpen\">Dropdown</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Scale In (Modal) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showModal\">Modal</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Up (Bottom Sheet) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n  leave-to-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showSheet\">Bottom Sheet</div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n### Accordion Pattern (Smooth Height)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst isOpen = ref(false)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"isOpen = !isOpen\">\n      Toggle Accordion\n    </button>\n    \n    <div\n      :class=\"[\n        'overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out',\n        isOpen ?

Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Spinning loader -->\n<div class=\"\n  w-8 h-8\n  border-4 border-neutral-200\n  border-t-primary-600\n  rounded-full\n  animate-spin\n\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pulsing loader (skeleton) -->\n<div class=\"\n  h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded\n  animate-pulse\n\">\n</div>\n```\n\n### Page Transition Pattern (Astro)\n\n```vue\n<!-- In Astro layout -->\n<div class=\"\n  animate-in fade-in duration-300\n\">\n  <slot />\n</div>\n```\n\n### Motion Preferences (Accessibility)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Respect prefers-reduced-motion -->\n<style>\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  * {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Animation Checklist\n\nWhen adding animations:\n- [ ] Duration is 150-300ms (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using `opacity` or `transform` (not width/height)\n- [ ] Easing is appropriate (ease-out for most)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show)\n```\n\n### 3.4 Spacing & Layout System\n\n```markdown\n## Spatial Rhythm System\n\n### Core Spacing Scale (Tailwind)\n\n**Use ONLY these values:** 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64\n\n**Avoid:** 5, 7, 10, 14, 20 (inconsistent, breaks rhythm)\n\n| Value | Pixels | Class | Use Case |\n|-------|--------|-------|----------|\n| 0.5 | 2px | `gap-0.5`, `p-0.5` | Micro spacing |\n| 1 | 4px | `gap-1`, `p-1` | Very tight |\n| 2 | 8px | `gap-2`, `p-2` | Tight groups (icon + text) |\n| 3 | 12px | `gap-3`, `p-3` | Compact spacing |\n| 4 | 16px | `gap-4`, `p-4` | Standard spacing (DEFAULT) |\n| 6 | 24px | `gap-6`, `p-6` | Comfortable spacing |\n| 8 | 32px | `gap-8`, `p-8` | Generous spacing |\n| 12 | 48px | `gap-12`, `p-12` | Section breaks |\n| 16 | 64px | `gap-16`, `p-16` | Major divisions |\n\n### Component Internal Spacing (gap)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Icon + Text (tight)

(justify) -->\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n  <h2>Title</h2>\n  <button>Action</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Container Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Page Container (max-width) -->\n<div class=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Section Container (breathing room) -->\n<section class=\"py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-24\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</section>\n\n<!-- Card Container -->\n<div class=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n  <!-- Centered card -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Spacing Decision Tree\n\n**Use `gap-2`:** Icon + text, tight button groups  \n**Use `gap-4`:** Form fields, related elements (DEFAULT)  \n**Use `gap-6`:** Card sections, distinct groups  \n**Use `gap-8`:** Major page sections  \n**Use `gap-12`+:** Hero sections, full-page breaks\n\n**Padding hierarchy:**  \n`p-4` → Mobile/compact  \n`p-6` → Standard (DEFAULT)  \n`p-8` → Spacious/desktop\n\n**Margin hierarchy:**  \n`mb-4` → Between elements  \n`mb-6` → Between groups  \n`mb-8` → Between sections  \n`mb-12`+ → Between major blocks\n```\n\n### 3.5 Icon System\n\n```markdown\n## Icon System Guidelines\n\n### Icon Library\n\n**Recommended:** Lucide Icons (clean,

</template>\n</Card>\n```\n\n### Scoped Slots (Data Passing)\n\n```vue\n<!-- DataList.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  items: Array<any>\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n    <div\n      v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n      :key=\"item.id\"\n    >\n      <slot :item=\"item\" :index=\"index\"

</template>\n</DataList>\n```\n\n### Fallback Content Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Alert.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.icon\" class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <slot name=\"icon\" />\n    </div>\n    <div v-else class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <!-- Default icon -->\n      <AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"alert-content\">\n      <slot>\n        <!-- Fallback if no content provided -->\n        <p>No message provided</p>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Conditional Slots Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Modal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useSlots } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst hasActions = computed(() => !!slots.actions)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div

When to Use Slots\n\n**Use slots when:**\n- ✅ Content structure varies significantly\n- ✅ Parent needs control over rendering\n- ✅ Building flexible, reusable components\n- ✅ Creating compound components (Card, Modal, Tabs)\n\n**Use props when:**\n- ✅ Data is simple (strings, numbers, booleans)\n- ✅ Component has fixed structure\n- ✅ Configuration over composition\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Part

Expert in CSS custom properties, Tailwind utilities, and design pattern recognition.\ntools: read, grep, bash, view\nmodel: claude-sonnet-4-20250514\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design systems expert specializing in design token analysis, pattern recognition, and design-system.css management for Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS projects.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n### 1. Design Token Analysis\n- Extract and validate CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n- Identify color schemes, spacing scales, typography systems\n- Detect token usage patterns across components\n- Flag hardcoded values that should use tokens\n\n### 2. Pattern Recognition\n- Search for similar existing components before creation\n- Identify composition opportunities\n- Detect duplication and suggest consolidation\n- Recognize provider patterns and reusable abstractions\n\n### 3. Design System Compliance\n- Validate components use only design tokens\n- Check for Tailwind utility class compliance\n- Identify @apply violations and inline styles\n- Ensure consistent naming conventions\n\n### 4. Token Management\n- Add new tokens to design-system.css when justified\n- Maintain token naming consistency\n- Document token usage and relationships\n- Suggest token deprecation when appropriate\n\n## Context Discovery Process\n\nWhen invoked, ALWAYS:\n\n1. **Read design-system.css** (`src/styles/design-system.css`)\n   - Extract current token definitions\n   - Understand color system and scales\n   - Note spacing and typography tokens\n\n2. **Search component directory** (`src/components/vue/`)\n   ```bash\n   find src/components/vue -name \"*.vue\" | head -20\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for similar patterns**\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"class.*{pattern}\" src/components/vue/\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for duplication**\n   - Look for platform-specific components\n   - Identify repeated patterns\n   - Suggest provider/composition approach\n\n## Analysis Output Format\n\nProvide analysis in this structure:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 Design Analysis\n\n### Existing Patterns Found\n- [List similar components with file paths]\n- [Composition opportunities identified]\n\n### Design Tokens Required\n- **Colors**: List required tokens\n- **Spacing**: List spacing needs\n- **Typography**: List font/size needs\n- **Missing Tokens**: New tokens to add\n\n### Compliance Issues\n- ❌ Hardcoded values found: [list]\n- ❌ Inline styles detected: [list]\n- ✅ Token usage: [percentage]\n\n### Recommendations\n1. [Reuse existing component X]\n2. [Add tokens: --color-{name}]\n3. [Refactor to provider pattern]\n```\n\n## Design System Rules\n\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n✅ Tailwind utility classes only\n✅ Computed classes for dynamic styling\n✅ Semantic token names (--color-primary, not --color-blue)\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb values\n❌ Inline style attributes\n❌ @apply directives\n❌ Custom px values not in design system\n\n## Token Naming Conventions\n\nFollow these patterns:\n- Colors: `--color-{semantic}-{shade}` (e.g., --color-primary-500)\n- Spacing: Use Tailwind scale (--spacing-4, --spacing-8)\n- Typography: `--font-{family}`, `--text-{size}`\n- Shadows: `--shadow-{size}`\n- Borders: `--border-{size}`\n- Radii: `--radius-{size}`\n\n## Search Strategy\n\n### Before Creating New Components:\n1. Search by functionality: `grep -r \"Button\" src/components/vue/`\n2. Search by pattern: `grep -r \"class.*btn\" src/components/vue/`\n3. Check ui/ and base/ directories first\n4. Look for provider patterns in config/\n\n### Composition Over Creation:\n- **Priority 1**: Reuse existing component\n- **Priority 2**: Compose from multiple components  \n- **Priority 3**: Extend base component\n- **Priority 4**: Create new only if justified\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- Limit initial context gathering to relevant files only\n- Use specific grep patterns for targeted searches\n- Focus on the most relevant 10-15 components\n- Don't read entire component directory at once\n\n## Communication Style\n\n- Be concise and actionable\n- Provide file paths for all references\n- Use bullet points for clarity\n- Include code examples when helpful\n- Flag critical issues immediately\n\n## Integration with Other Agents\n\n- **Feed to ui-builder**: Design tokens and patterns found\n- **Feed to ui-validator**: Compliance issues to check\n- **Feed to ui-documenter**: Token documentation needs\n\nYou work proactively - when you see requests for new components, AUTOMATICALLY analyze first before any code is written.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":33,"oldLines":6,"newStart":33,"newLines":12,"lines":[" - Document token usage and relationships"," - Suggest token deprecation when appropriate"," ","+### 5.

Expert in CSS custom properties, Tailwind utilities, and design pattern recognition.\ntools: read, grep, bash, view\nmodel: claude-sonnet-4-20250514\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design systems expert specializing in design token analysis, pattern recognition, and design-system.css management for Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS projects.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n### 1. Design Token Analysis\n- Extract and validate CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n- Identify color schemes, spacing scales, typography systems\n- Detect token usage patterns across components\n- Flag hardcoded values that should use tokens\n\n### 2. Pattern Recognition\n- Search for similar existing components before creation\n- Identify composition opportunities\n- Detect duplication and suggest consolidation\n- Recognize provider patterns and reusable abstractions\n\n### 3. Design System Compliance\n- Validate components use only design tokens\n- Check for Tailwind utility class compliance\n- Identify @apply violations and inline styles\n- Ensure consistent naming conventions\n\n### 4. Token Management\n- Add new tokens to design-system.css when justified\n- Maintain token naming consistency\n- Document token usage and relationships\n- Suggest token deprecation when appropriate\n\n### 5. Design Quality Scoring\n- Analyze components against depth, typography, motion, and interactive state standards\n- Calculate quality scores for professional UI polish\n- Provide actionable recommendations for improvements\n- Report comprehensive design quality metrics\n\n## Context Discovery Process\n\nWhen invoked, ALWAYS:\n\n1. **Read design-system.css** (`src/styles/design-system.css`)\n   - Extract current token definitions\n   - Understand color system and scales\n   - Note spacing and typography tokens\n\n2. **Search component directory** (`src/components/vue/`)\n   ```bash\n   find src/components/vue -name \"*.vue\" | head -20\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for similar patterns**\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"class.*{pattern}\" src/components/vue/\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for duplication**\n   - Look for platform-specific components\n   - Identify repeated patterns\n   - Suggest provider/composition approach\n\n## Analysis Output Format\n\nProvide analysis in this structure:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 Design Analysis\n\n### Existing Patterns Found\n- [List similar components with file paths]\n- [Composition opportunities identified]\n\n### Design Tokens Required\n- **Colors**: List required tokens\n- **Spacing**: List spacing needs\n- **Typography**: List font/size needs\n- **Missing Tokens**: New tokens to add\n\n### Compliance Issues\n- ❌ Hardcoded values found: [list]\n- ❌ Inline styles detected: [list]\n- ✅ Token usage: [percentage]\n\n### Recommendations\n1. [Reuse existing component X]\n2. [Add tokens: --color-{name}]\n3. [Refactor to provider pattern]\n```\n\n## Design System Rules\n\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n✅ Tailwind utility classes only\n✅ Computed classes for dynamic styling\n✅ Semantic token names (--color-primary, not --color-blue)\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb values\n❌ Inline style attributes\n❌ @apply directives\n❌ Custom px values not in design system\n\n## Token Naming Conventions\n\nFollow these patterns:\n- Colors: `--color-{semantic}-{shade}` (e.g., --color-primary-500)\n- Spacing: Use Tailwind scale (--spacing-4, --spacing-8)\n- Typography: `--font-{family}`, `--text-{size}`\n- Shadows: `--shadow-{size}`\n- Borders: `--border-{size}`\n- Radii: `--radius-{size}`\n\n## Search Strategy\n\n### Before Creating New Components:\n1. Search by functionality: `grep -r \"Button\" src/components/vue/`\n2. Search by pattern: `grep -r \"class.*btn\" src/components/vue/`\n3. Check ui/ and base/ directories first\n4. Look for provider patterns in config/\n\n### Composition Over Creation:\n- **Priority 1**: Reuse existing component\n- **Priority 2**: Compose from multiple components  \n- **Priority 3**: Extend base component\n- **Priority 4**: Create new only if justified\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- Limit initial context gathering to relevant files only\n- Use specific grep patterns for targeted searches\n- Focus on the most relevant 10-15 components\n- Don't read entire component directory at once\n\n## Communication Style\n\n- Be concise and actionable\n- Provide file paths for all references\n- Use bullet points for clarity\n- Include code examples when helpful\n- Flag critical issues immediately\n\n## Integration with Other Agents\n\n- **Feed to ui-builder**: Design tokens and patterns found\n- **Feed to ui-validator**: Compliance issues to check\n- **Feed to ui-documenter**: Token documentation needs\n\nYou work proactively - when you see requests for new components, AUTOMATICALLY analyze first before any code is written.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":91,"oldLines":6,"newStart":91,"newLines":88,"lines":[" 3.

Context is precious.\n\n**Always /clear when:**\n```bash\n# After completing any feature\ngit commit -m \"Add authentication system\"\n/clear\n\n# Before starting unrelated tasks\n/clear\n\"Now let's work on the email notification system\"\n\n# When switching between unrelated areas\n# Example: Frontend → Backend → DevOps\n/clear\n\"Switch to backend API development\"\n\n# When Claude seems confused or loops\n/clear\n\"Let's start fresh. Here's what I need...\"\n\n# Before visual regression tests (reset mental model)\n/clear\n/ui-visual-regression [component-path]\n```\n\n**Don't /clear when:**\n- Mid-feature implementation\n- Iterating on same component\n- Following multi-step plan\n- Claude is actively debugging\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If your next prompt is unrelated to the last 5 messages, /clear first.\n```\n\n### 1.2 Scratchpad System\n\n```markdown\n### Task Planning: .temp Folder\n\nFor complex multi-step tasks, externalize planning to save context for execution.\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```bash\n.temp/\n├── REFACTOR_PAD.md      # Current refactor planning\n├── DASHBOARD_PAD.md     # Dashboard feature planning\n├── MIGRATION_PAD.md     # Migration planning\n└── [TASK]_PAD.md        # Any task-specific scratchpad\n```\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n```bash\n# Start complex task\n\"Plan the provider pattern refactor in .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\"\n\n# Claude creates structured plan:\n## Task: Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n### Analysis\n- Current state: 57 duplicate platform components\n- What needs to change: Consolidate to BaseProviderCard + config\n- Potential issues: Testing, migration path\n\n### Plan\n1. Create BaseProviderCard component with slot system\n2. Create providers.ts configuration\n3. Migrate Facebook components (test)\n4. Migrate remaining platforms\n5. Remove deprecated files\n\n### Files to Modify\n- src/components/vue/base/BaseProviderCard.vue (NEW)\n- src/config/providers.ts (NEW)\n- src/components/vue/cards/FacebookCard.vue (REFACTOR)\n- [... 56 more files]\n\n### Validation\n- [ ] All platforms render correctly\n- [ ] Props pass through properly\n- [ ] Visual regression tests pass\n- [ ] Console errors clear\n\n# Review and approve\n\"Looks good, proceed with step 1\"\n\n# Claude executes step 1\n\n# Continue iteratively\n\"Show me what changed, then move to step 2\"\n\n# When complete, cleanup\nrm .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Planning is explicit and reviewable\n- Can pause/resume at any step\n- Context focused on execution, not planning\n- Can /clear between steps without losing plan\n- Works for ANY complex task\n\n**Examples across workflows:**\n```bash\n# Component refactor\n\"Plan the modal redesign in .temp/MODAL_PAD.md\"\n\n# Multi-file change\n\"Plan the authentication flow in .temp/AUTH_PAD.md\"\n\n# Migration\n\"Plan the Tailwind v4 upgrade in .temp/UPGRADE_PAD.md\"\n```\n```\n\n### 1.3 Persistent Decisions\n\n```markdown\n### Permanent Decisions: .claude/decisions.md\n\nFor architectural decisions that should persist across sessions.\n\n**Create:** `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**Only document:**\n- Technology choices (why X over Y)\n- Architecture patterns (why we structure things this way)\n- Breaking changes (what changed and why)\n- Failed approaches (so Claude doesn't retry them)\n\n**Format:**\n```markdown\n## [Decision Name] - [YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n**Context:** What prompted this decision\n**Decision:** What we decided to do\n**Reasoning:** Why we made this choice\n**Alternatives Considered:** What we didn't choose and why\n**Impact:** What this affects\n\n---\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Nanostore Over Pinia - 2025-10-15\n\n**Context:** Need global state management for user auth and theme\n\n**Decision:** Use Nanostore instead of Pinia\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Lighter weight (1kb vs 10kb)\n- Framework agnostic (works with Astro pages)\n- Simpler API for our use case\n- No Vue-specific coupling\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Pinia: Too heavy, Vue-specific\n- Vuex: Deprecated\n- Context/Provide: Doesn't work across Astro boundaries\n\n**Impact:** All global state uses Nanostore atoms\n\n---\n```\n\n**When to add:**\n- Once per major decision\n- Not for every component choice\n- Focus on \"why\" not \"what\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Part 2: Core Design Principles\n\n> **Location:** Add to `/CLAUDE.md` and update `design-system.css`  \n> **Benefit:** Professional UI quality, consistent visual language\n\n### 2.1 Depth Through Shadows (No Borders)\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 UI Design Principles\n\n### Depth Through Shadows & Color Layering\n\n**Problem:** Borders make UIs look flat and dated.\n\n**Solution:** Use shadows and color layering to create depth.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. Generate 3-4 shades for each base color\n2. Darker shades = background layers\n3. Lighter shades = foreground elements  \n4. Eliminate borders where possible\n5. Use dual-shadow system (light + dark)\n\n**Shadow System:**\n```css\n/* Three-tier shadow system */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);           /* Subtle elevation */\n--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),\n             0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);            /* Standard cards */\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n             0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);             /* Modals, popovers */\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15),\n             0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);           /* Hero sections */\n```\n\n**Tailwind pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Old: Borders -->\n<div class=\"border border-gray-300 rounded-lg\">\n\n<!-- ✅ New: Shadows + Color Layers -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 shadow-md rounded-lg\">\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg p-6\">\n    <!-- Content on lighter bg = elevated -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Color layering pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- Page → Section → Card → Content -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50\">              <!-- Darkest (page bg) -->\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-100 shadow-sm\">  <!-- Section bg -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white shadow-md\">   <!-- Card bg -->\n      <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-4\">     <!-- Elevated content -->\n        <!-- Lightest = highest elevation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**When borders ARE okay:**\n- Input fields (functional affordance)\n- Focus states (accessibility requirement)\n- Table cells (data separation)\n- Dividers (semantic separation)\n\n**Prompt pattern for Claude:**\n\"Use shadow-md and color layering (bg-gray-50/100) for depth. Avoid borders except for inputs and focus states.\"\n```\n\n### 2.2 Semantic Color Palette\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Semantic Color Palette System\n\n**Define 4 color types before any design work:**\n\n1. **Primary** — CTAs, key actions, brand identity\n2. **Secondary** — Subtle highlights, accents, secondary actions\n3. **Neutral** — Backgrounds, text, UI chrome (grays)\n4. **Semantic** — States (success, warning, error, info)\n\n**Token structure:**\n```css\n/* Primary (Brand) */\n--color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n--color-primary-500: #ef4444;   /* Base - buttons, links */\n--color-primary-600: #dc2626;   /* Hover state */\n--color-primary-700: #b91c1c;   /* Active state */\n--color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n\n/* Secondary (Accent) */\n--color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n--color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;  /* Base */\n--color-secondary-600: #0d9488;  /* Hover */\n\n/* Neutral (Grays) */\n--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;    /* Page background */\n--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;   /* Section background */\n--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;   /* Card background */\n--color-neutral-300: #d4d4d4;   /* Input borders */\n--color-neutral-400: #a3a3a3;   /* Disabled text */\n--color-neutral-500: #737373;   /* Secondary text */\n--color-neutral-700: #404040;   /* Body text */\n--color-neutral-900: #171717;   /* Headings */\n\n/* Semantic (States) */\n--color-success-50: #f0fdf4;\n--color-success-500: #22c55e;   /* Success messages */\n--color-warning-50: #fffbeb;\n--color-warning-500: #f59e0b;   /* Warning messages */\n--color-error-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-error-500: #ef4444;     /* Error messages */\n--color-info-50: #eff6ff;\n--color-info-500: #3b82f6;      /* Info messages */\n```\n\n**Usage rules:**\n- Primary: 1-2 uses per screen (CTAs only)\n- Secondary: Supporting actions, badges, highlights\n- Neutral: Everything else (80% of UI)\n- Semantic: State feedback only (not decoration)\n\n**Tailwind mapping:**\n```vue\n<!-- Primary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700\">\n\n<!-- Secondary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600\">\n\n<!-- Backgrounds (depth layering) -->\n<div class=\"bg-neutral-50\">        <!-- Page -->\n  <div class=\"bg-neutral-100\">     <!-- Section -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white\">         <!-- Card -->\n\n<!-- Semantic states -->\n<div class=\"bg-success-50 text-success-700 border border-success-200\">\n  ✓ Success message\n</div>\n```\n```\n\n### 2.3 Priority-Based Mobile Rearrangement\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Mobile-First: Priority Rearrangement\n\n**Problem:** Treating responsive as \"make it smaller\" produces bad mobile UX.\n\n**Solution:** Reorganize by priority on mobile, don't just shrink.\n\n**Priority system:**\n1. **Critical** — Primary action, key info (always visible)\n2. **Important** — Secondary actions, supporting content (visible but demoted)\n3. **Optional** — Tertiary features, extra info (collapsed/hidden)\n\n**Desktop vs Mobile structure:**\n```vue\n<!-- Desktop: Side-by-side layout -->\n<div class=\"lg:flex lg:gap-8\">\n  <aside class=\"lg:w-64\">\n    <!-- Filters, secondary nav -->\n  </aside>\n  <main class=\"lg:flex-1\">\n    <!-- Primary content -->\n  </main>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: Stacked by priority -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <!-- 1. Search/filter (critical - user intent) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <SearchBar />\n  </div>\n  \n  <!-- 2. Primary content (most important) -->\n  <main>\n    <ContentGrid />\n  </main>\n  \n  <!-- 3. Filters (collapsible - optional) -->\n  <details class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <summary>Filters</summary>\n    <FilterPanel />\n  </details>\n  \n  <!-- 4. Secondary nav (bottom sheet - tertiary) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden fixed bottom-0\">\n    <BottomNav />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Common mobile patterns:**\n```vue\n<!-- Pattern 1: Fixed bottom CTA (mobile) -->\n<button class=\"\n  md:static md:inline-flex\n  fixed bottom-4 left-4 right-4 w-auto\n  md:w-auto\n\">\n  Primary Action\n</button>\n\n<!-- Pattern 2: Horizontal scroll (mobile cards) -->\n<div class=\"\n  flex gap-4 overflow-x-auto md:grid md:grid-cols-3\n  snap-x snap-mandatory\n\">\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pattern 3: Collapsible sections (mobile) -->\n<div class=\"md:block hidden\">\n  <!-- Always visible on desktop -->\n</div>\n<details class=\"md:hidden\">\n  <summary class=\"font-medium cursor-pointer\">\n    Show Additional Info\n  </summary>\n  <div class=\"mt-4\">\n    <!-- Collapsed on mobile -->\n  </div>\n</details>\n```\n\n**Breakpoint strategy:**\n- `< 640px` (mobile): Single column, stacked by priority\n- `640-768px` (tablet): 2 columns or expanded single column\n- `> 768px` (desktop): Full layout with sidebars\n\n**Testing checklist:**\n- [ ] Critical actions visible without scrolling (mobile)\n- [ ] Content readable without zoom\n- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- [ ] No horizontal scroll (except intentional carousels)\n- [ ] Form inputs don't cause zoom on iOS\n```\n\n### 2.4 Update design-system.css\n\nAdd these tokens to `src/styles/design-system.css`:\n\n```css\n/* Add to design-system.css */\n\n/* ========================================\n   DEPTH SYSTEM (Shadows)\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Shadow scale */\n  --shadow-xs: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07),\n               0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),\n               0 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-2xl: 0 25px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  \n  /* Inner shadows for depth inversion */\n  --shadow-inner: inset 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n}\n\n/* ========================================\n   SEMANTIC COLOR PALETTE\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Primary (Brand/CTA) */\n  --color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n  --color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n  --color-primary-200: #fecaca;\n  --color-primary-300: #fca5a5;\n  --color-primary-400: #f87171;\n  --color-primary-500: #ef4444;\n  --color-primary-600: #dc2626;\n  --color-primary-700: #b91c1c;\n  --color-primary-800: #991b1b;\n  --color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n  \n  /* Secondary (Accent) */\n  --color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n  --color-secondary-100: #ccfbf1;\n  --color-secondary-200: #99f6e4;\n  --color-secondary-300: #5eead4;\n  --color-secondary-400: #2dd4bf;\n  --color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;\n  --color-secondary-600: #0d9488;\n  --color-secondary-700: #0f766e;\n  --color-secondary-800: #115e59;\n  --color-secondary-900: #134e4a;\n  \n  /* Neutral (Grays) -

Faster = more responsive feel.\n\n### Easing Functions\n\n```vue\n<!-- Ease Out (MOST COMMON) - Ending animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\">\n  <!-- Elements leaving, fading out, dropdown close -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In - Starting animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\">\n  <!-- Elements entering, fading in -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In-Out - Continuous motion -->\n<div class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out\">\n  <!-- Sliding panels, moving elements -->\n</div>\n```\n\n**Default:** Use `ease-out` for 90% of animations.\n\n### What to Animate\n\n**✅ Animate these (performant):**\n- `opacity` — Fades\n- `transform` — Move, scale, rotate\n- `max-height` — Accordions (with overflow-hidden)\n- `filter` — Blur, brightness (use sparingly)\n\n**❌ Don't animate these (causes reflow):**\n- `width`, `height` — Use `scale` instead\n- `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` — Use `transform: translate` instead\n- `padding`, `margin` — Causes layout shift\n\n### Common Animation Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Fade In/Out -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Content</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Down (Dropdown) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"isOpen\">Dropdown</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Scale In (Modal) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showModal\">Modal</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Up (Bottom Sheet) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n  leave-to-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showSheet\">Bottom Sheet</div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n### Accordion Pattern (Smooth Height)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst isOpen = ref(false)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"isOpen = !isOpen\">\n      Toggle Accordion\n    </button>\n    \n    <div\n      :class=\"[\n        'overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out',\n        isOpen ?

Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Spinning loader -->\n<div class=\"\n  w-8 h-8\n  border-4 border-neutral-200\n  border-t-primary-600\n  rounded-full\n  animate-spin\n\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pulsing loader (skeleton) -->\n<div class=\"\n  h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded\n  animate-pulse\n\">\n</div>\n```\n\n### Page Transition Pattern (Astro)\n\n```vue\n<!-- In Astro layout -->\n<div class=\"\n  animate-in fade-in duration-300\n\">\n  <slot />\n</div>\n```\n\n### Motion Preferences (Accessibility)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Respect prefers-reduced-motion -->\n<style>\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  * {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Animation Checklist\n\nWhen adding animations:\n- [ ] Duration is 150-300ms (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using `opacity` or `transform` (not width/height)\n- [ ] Easing is appropriate (ease-out for most)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show)\n```\n\n### 3.4 Spacing & Layout System\n\n```markdown\n## Spatial Rhythm System\n\n### Core Spacing Scale (Tailwind)\n\n**Use ONLY these values:** 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64\n\n**Avoid:** 5, 7, 10, 14, 20 (inconsistent, breaks rhythm)\n\n| Value | Pixels | Class | Use Case |\n|-------|--------|-------|----------|\n| 0.5 | 2px | `gap-0.5`, `p-0.5` | Micro spacing |\n| 1 | 4px | `gap-1`, `p-1` | Very tight |\n| 2 | 8px | `gap-2`, `p-2` | Tight groups (icon + text) |\n| 3 | 12px | `gap-3`, `p-3` | Compact spacing |\n| 4 | 16px | `gap-4`, `p-4` | Standard spacing (DEFAULT) |\n| 6 | 24px | `gap-6`, `p-6` | Comfortable spacing |\n| 8 | 32px | `gap-8`, `p-8` | Generous spacing |\n| 12 | 48px | `gap-12`, `p-12` | Section breaks |\n| 16 | 64px | `gap-16`, `p-16` | Major divisions |\n\n### Component Internal Spacing (gap)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Icon + Text (tight) -->\n<button class=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n  <Icon class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n  <span>Button Text</span>\n</button>\n\n<!-- Form fields (related elements) -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <input

(justify) -->\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n  <h2>Title</h2>\n  <button>Action</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Container Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Page Container (max-width) -->\n<div class=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Section Container (breathing room) -->\n<section class=\"py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-24\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</section>\n\n<!-- Card Container -->\n<div class=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n  <!-- Centered card -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Spacing Decision Tree\n\n**Use `gap-2`:** Icon + text, tight button groups  \n**Use `gap-4`:** Form fields, related elements (DEFAULT)  \n**Use `gap-6`:** Card sections, distinct groups  \n**Use `gap-8`:** Major page sections  \n**Use `gap-12`+:** Hero sections, full-page breaks\n\n**Padding hierarchy:**  \n`p-4` → Mobile/compact  \n`p-6` → Standard (DEFAULT)  \n`p-8` → Spacious/desktop\n\n**Margin hierarchy:**  \n`mb-4` → Between elements  \n`mb-6` → Between groups  \n`mb-8` → Between sections  \n`mb-12`+ → Between major blocks\n```\n\n### 3.5 Icon System\n\n```markdown\n## Icon System Guidelines\n\n### Icon Library\n\n**Recommended:** Lucide Icons (clean,

</template>\n</Card>\n```\n\n### Scoped Slots (Data Passing)\n\n```vue\n<!-- DataList.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  items: Array<any>\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n    <div\n      v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n      :key=\"item.id\"\n    >\n      <slot :item=\"item\" :index=\"index\"

</template>\n</DataList>\n```\n\n### Fallback Content Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Alert.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.icon\" class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <slot name=\"icon\" />\n    </div>\n    <div v-else class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <!-- Default icon -->\n      <AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"alert-content\">\n      <slot>\n        <!-- Fallback if no content provided -->\n        <p>No message provided</p>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Conditional Slots Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Modal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useSlots } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst hasActions = computed(() => !!slots.actions)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div

When to Use Slots\n\n**Use slots when:**\n- ✅ Content structure varies significantly\n- ✅ Parent needs control over rendering\n- ✅ Building flexible, reusable components\n- ✅ Creating compound components (Card, Modal, Tabs)\n\n**Use props when:**\n- ✅ Data is simple (strings, numbers, booleans)\n- ✅ Component has fixed structure\n- ✅ Configuration over composition\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Part

Context is precious.\n\n**Always /clear when:**\n```bash\n# After completing any feature\ngit commit -m \"Add authentication system\"\n/clear\n\n# Before starting unrelated tasks\n/clear\n\"Now let's work on the email notification system\"\n\n# When switching between unrelated areas\n# Example: Frontend → Backend → DevOps\n/clear\n\"Switch to backend API development\"\n\n# When Claude seems confused or loops\n/clear\n\"Let's start fresh. Here's what I need...\"\n\n# Before visual regression tests (reset mental model)\n/clear\n/ui-visual-regression [component-path]\n```\n\n**Don't /clear when:**\n- Mid-feature implementation\n- Iterating on same component\n- Following multi-step plan\n- Claude is actively debugging\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If your next prompt is unrelated to the last 5 messages, /clear first.\n```\n\n### 1.2 Scratchpad System\n\n```markdown\n### Task Planning: .temp Folder\n\nFor complex multi-step tasks, externalize planning to save context for execution.\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```bash\n.temp/\n├── REFACTOR_PAD.md      # Current refactor planning\n├── DASHBOARD_PAD.md     # Dashboard feature planning\n├── MIGRATION_PAD.md     # Migration planning\n└── [TASK]_PAD.md        # Any task-specific scratchpad\n```\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n```bash\n# Start complex task\n\"Plan the provider pattern refactor in .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\"\n\n# Claude creates structured plan:\n## Task: Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n### Analysis\n- Current state: 57 duplicate platform components\n- What needs to change: Consolidate to BaseProviderCard + config\n- Potential issues: Testing, migration path\n\n### Plan\n1. Create BaseProviderCard component with slot system\n2. Create providers.ts configuration\n3. Migrate Facebook components (test)\n4. Migrate remaining platforms\n5. Remove deprecated files\n\n### Files to Modify\n- src/components/vue/base/BaseProviderCard.vue (NEW)\n- src/config/providers.ts (NEW)\n- src/components/vue/cards/FacebookCard.vue (REFACTOR)\n- [... 56 more files]\n\n### Validation\n- [ ] All platforms render correctly\n- [ ] Props pass through properly\n- [ ] Visual regression tests pass\n- [ ] Console errors clear\n\n# Review and approve\n\"Looks good, proceed with step 1\"\n\n# Claude executes step 1\n\n# Continue iteratively\n\"Show me what changed, then move to step 2\"\n\n# When complete, cleanup\nrm .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Planning is explicit and reviewable\n- Can pause/resume at any step\n- Context focused on execution, not planning\n- Can /clear between steps without losing plan\n- Works for ANY complex task\n\n**Examples across workflows:**\n```bash\n# Component refactor\n\"Plan the modal redesign in .temp/MODAL_PAD.md\"\n\n# Multi-file change\n\"Plan the authentication flow in .temp/AUTH_PAD.md\"\n\n# Migration\n\"Plan the Tailwind v4 upgrade in .temp/UPGRADE_PAD.md\"\n```\n```\n\n### 1.3 Persistent Decisions\n\n```markdown\n### Permanent Decisions: .claude/decisions.md\n\nFor architectural decisions that should persist across sessions.\n\n**Create:** `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**Only document:**\n- Technology choices (why X over Y)\n- Architecture patterns (why we structure things this way)\n- Breaking changes (what changed and why)\n- Failed approaches (so Claude doesn't retry them)\n\n**Format:**\n```markdown\n## [Decision Name] - [YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n**Context:** What prompted this decision\n**Decision:** What we decided to do\n**Reasoning:** Why we made this choice\n**Alternatives Considered:** What we didn't choose and why\n**Impact:** What this affects\n\n---\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Nanostore Over Pinia - 2025-10-15\n\n**Context:** Need global state management for user auth and theme\n\n**Decision:** Use Nanostore instead of Pinia\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Lighter weight (1kb vs 10kb)\n- Framework agnostic (works with Astro pages)\n- Simpler API for our use case\n- No Vue-specific coupling\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Pinia: Too heavy, Vue-specific\n- Vuex: Deprecated\n- Context/Provide: Doesn't work across Astro boundaries\n\n**Impact:** All global state uses Nanostore atoms\n\n---\n```\n\n**When to add:**\n- Once per major decision\n- Not for every component choice\n- Focus on \"why\" not \"what\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Part 2: Core Design Principles\n\n> **Location:** Add to `/CLAUDE.md` and update `design-system.css`  \n> **Benefit:** Professional UI quality, consistent visual language\n\n### 2.1 Depth Through Shadows (No Borders)\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 UI Design Principles\n\n### Depth Through Shadows & Color Layering\n\n**Problem:** Borders make UIs look flat and dated.\n\n**Solution:** Use shadows and color layering to create depth.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. Generate 3-4 shades for each base color\n2. Darker shades = background layers\n3. Lighter shades = foreground elements  \n4. Eliminate borders where possible\n5. Use dual-shadow system (light + dark)\n\n**Shadow System:**\n```css\n/* Three-tier shadow system */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);           /* Subtle elevation */\n--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),\n             0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);            /* Standard cards */\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n             0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);             /* Modals, popovers */\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15),\n             0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);           /* Hero sections */\n```\n\n**Tailwind pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Old: Borders -->\n<div class=\"border border-gray-300 rounded-lg\">\n\n<!-- ✅ New: Shadows + Color Layers -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 shadow-md rounded-lg\">\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg p-6\">\n    <!-- Content on lighter bg = elevated -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Color layering pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- Page → Section → Card → Content -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50\">              <!-- Darkest (page bg) -->\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-100 shadow-sm\">  <!-- Section bg -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white shadow-md\">   <!-- Card bg -->\n      <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-4\">     <!-- Elevated content -->\n        <!-- Lightest = highest elevation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**When borders ARE okay:**\n- Input fields (functional affordance)\n- Focus states (accessibility requirement)\n- Table cells (data separation)\n- Dividers (semantic separation)\n\n**Prompt pattern for Claude:**\n\"Use shadow-md and color layering (bg-gray-50/100) for depth. Avoid borders except for inputs and focus states.\"\n```\n\n### 2.2 Semantic Color Palette\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Semantic Color Palette System\n\n**Define 4 color types before any design work:**\n\n1. **Primary** — CTAs, key actions, brand identity\n2. **Secondary** — Subtle highlights, accents, secondary actions\n3. **Neutral** — Backgrounds, text, UI chrome (grays)\n4. **Semantic** — States (success, warning, error, info)\n\n**Token structure:**\n```css\n/* Primary (Brand) */\n--color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n--color-primary-500: #ef4444;   /* Base - buttons, links */\n--color-primary-600: #dc2626;   /* Hover state */\n--color-primary-700: #b91c1c;   /* Active state */\n--color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n\n/* Secondary (Accent) */\n--color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n--color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;  /* Base */\n--color-secondary-600: #0d9488;  /* Hover */\n\n/* Neutral (Grays) */\n--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;    /* Page background */\n--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;   /* Section background */\n--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;   /* Card background */\n--color-neutral-300: #d4d4d4;   /* Input borders */\n--color-neutral-400: #a3a3a3;   /* Disabled text */\n--color-neutral-500: #737373;   /* Secondary text */\n--color-neutral-700: #404040;   /* Body text */\n--color-neutral-900: #171717;   /* Headings */\n\n/* Semantic (States) */\n--color-success-50: #f0fdf4;\n--color-success-500: #22c55e;   /* Success messages */\n--color-warning-50: #fffbeb;\n--color-warning-500: #f59e0b;   /* Warning messages */\n--color-error-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-error-500: #ef4444;     /* Error messages */\n--color-info-50: #eff6ff;\n--color-info-500: #3b82f6;      /* Info messages */\n```\n\n**Usage rules:**\n- Primary: 1-2 uses per screen (CTAs only)\n- Secondary: Supporting actions, badges, highlights\n- Neutral: Everything else (80% of UI)\n- Semantic: State feedback only (not decoration)\n\n**Tailwind mapping:**\n```vue\n<!-- Primary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700\">\n\n<!-- Secondary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600\">\n\n<!-- Backgrounds (depth layering) -->\n<div class=\"bg-neutral-50\">        <!-- Page -->\n  <div class=\"bg-neutral-100\">     <!-- Section -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white\">         <!-- Card -->\n\n<!-- Semantic states -->\n<div class=\"bg-success-50 text-success-700 border border-success-200\">\n  ✓ Success message\n</div>\n```\n```\n\n### 2.3 Priority-Based Mobile Rearrangement\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Mobile-First: Priority Rearrangement\n\n**Problem:** Treating responsive as \"make it smaller\" produces bad mobile UX.\n\n**Solution:** Reorganize by priority on mobile, don't just shrink.\n\n**Priority system:**\n1. **Critical** — Primary action, key info (always visible)\n2. **Important** — Secondary actions, supporting content (visible but demoted)\n3. **Optional** — Tertiary features, extra info (collapsed/hidden)\n\n**Desktop vs Mobile structure:**\n```vue\n<!-- Desktop: Side-by-side layout -->\n<div class=\"lg:flex lg:gap-8\">\n  <aside class=\"lg:w-64\">\n    <!-- Filters, secondary nav -->\n  </aside>\n  <main class=\"lg:flex-1\">\n    <!-- Primary content -->\n  </main>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: Stacked by priority -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <!-- 1. Search/filter (critical - user intent) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <SearchBar />\n  </div>\n  \n  <!-- 2. Primary content (most important) -->\n  <main>\n    <ContentGrid />\n  </main>\n  \n  <!-- 3. Filters (collapsible - optional) -->\n  <details class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <summary>Filters</summary>\n    <FilterPanel />\n  </details>\n  \n  <!-- 4. Secondary nav (bottom sheet - tertiary) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden fixed bottom-0\">\n    <BottomNav />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Common mobile patterns:**\n```vue\n<!-- Pattern 1: Fixed bottom CTA (mobile) -->\n<button class=\"\n  md:static md:inline-flex\n  fixed bottom-4 left-4 right-4 w-auto\n  md:w-auto\n\">\n  Primary Action\n</button>\n\n<!-- Pattern 2: Horizontal scroll (mobile cards) -->\n<div class=\"\n  flex gap-4 overflow-x-auto md:grid md:grid-cols-3\n  snap-x snap-mandatory\n\">\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pattern 3: Collapsible sections (mobile) -->\n<div class=\"md:block hidden\">\n  <!-- Always visible on desktop -->\n</div>\n<details class=\"md:hidden\">\n  <summary class=\"font-medium cursor-pointer\">\n    Show Additional Info\n  </summary>\n  <div class=\"mt-4\">\n    <!-- Collapsed on mobile -->\n  </div>\n</details>\n```\n\n**Breakpoint strategy:**\n- `< 640px` (mobile): Single column, stacked by priority\n- `640-768px` (tablet): 2 columns or expanded single column\n- `> 768px` (desktop): Full layout with sidebars\n\n**Testing checklist:**\n- [ ] Critical actions visible without scrolling (mobile)\n- [ ] Content readable without zoom\n- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- [ ] No horizontal scroll (except intentional carousels)\n- [ ] Form inputs don't cause zoom on iOS\n```\n\n### 2.4 Update design-system.css\n\nAdd these tokens to `src/styles/design-system.css`:\n\n```css\n/* Add to design-system.css */\n\n/* ========================================\n   DEPTH SYSTEM (Shadows)\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Shadow scale */\n  --shadow-xs: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07),\n               0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),\n               0 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-2xl: 0 25px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  \n  /* Inner shadows for depth inversion */\n  --shadow-inner: inset 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n}\n\n/* ========================================\n   SEMANTIC COLOR PALETTE\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Primary (Brand/CTA) */\n  --color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n  --color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n  --color-primary-200: #fecaca;\n  --color-primary-300: #fca5a5;\n  --color-primary-400: #f87171;\n  --color-primary-500: #ef4444;\n  --color-primary-600: #dc2626;\n  --color-primary-700: #b91c1c;\n  --color-primary-800: #991b1b;\n  --color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n  \n  /* Secondary (Accent) */\n  --color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n  --color-secondary-100: #ccfbf1;\n  --color-secondary-200: #99f6e4;\n  --color-secondary-300: #5eead4;\n  --color-secondary-400: #2dd4bf;\n  --color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;\n  --color-secondary-600: #0d9488;\n  --color-secondary-700: #0f766e;\n  --color-secondary-800: #115e59;\n  --color-secondary-900: #134e4a;\n  \n  /* Neutral (Grays) -

Faster = more responsive feel.\n\n### Easing Functions\n\n```vue\n<!-- Ease Out (MOST COMMON) - Ending animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\">\n  <!-- Elements leaving, fading out, dropdown close -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In - Starting animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\">\n  <!-- Elements entering, fading in -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In-Out - Continuous motion -->\n<div class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out\">\n  <!-- Sliding panels, moving elements -->\n</div>\n```\n\n**Default:** Use `ease-out` for 90% of animations.\n\n### What to Animate\n\n**✅ Animate these (performant):**\n- `opacity` — Fades\n- `transform` — Move, scale, rotate\n- `max-height` — Accordions (with overflow-hidden)\n- `filter` — Blur, brightness (use sparingly)\n\n**❌ Don't animate these (causes reflow):**\n- `width`, `height` — Use `scale` instead\n- `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` — Use `transform: translate` instead\n- `padding`, `margin` — Causes layout shift\n\n### Common Animation Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Fade In/Out -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Content</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Down (Dropdown) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"isOpen\">Dropdown</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Scale In (Modal) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showModal\">Modal</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Up (Bottom Sheet) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n  leave-to-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showSheet\">Bottom Sheet</div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n### Accordion Pattern (Smooth Height)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst isOpen = ref(false)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"isOpen = !isOpen\">\n      Toggle Accordion\n    </button>\n    \n    <div\n      :class=\"[\n        'overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out',\n        isOpen ?

Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Spinning loader -->\n<div class=\"\n  w-8 h-8\n  border-4 border-neutral-200\n  border-t-primary-600\n  rounded-full\n  animate-spin\n\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pulsing loader (skeleton) -->\n<div class=\"\n  h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded\n  animate-pulse\n\">\n</div>\n```\n\n### Page Transition Pattern (Astro)\n\n```vue\n<!-- In Astro layout -->\n<div class=\"\n  animate-in fade-in duration-300\n\">\n  <slot />\n</div>\n```\n\n### Motion Preferences (Accessibility)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Respect prefers-reduced-motion -->\n<style>\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  * {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Animation Checklist\n\nWhen adding animations:\n- [ ] Duration is 150-300ms (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using `opacity` or `transform` (not width/height)\n- [ ] Easing is appropriate (ease-out for most)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show)\n```\n\n### 3.4 Spacing & Layout System\n\n```markdown\n## Spatial Rhythm System\n\n### Core Spacing Scale (Tailwind)\n\n**Use ONLY these values:** 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64\n\n**Avoid:** 5, 7, 10, 14, 20 (inconsistent, breaks rhythm)\n\n| Value | Pixels | Class | Use Case |\n|-------|--------|-------|----------|\n| 0.5 | 2px | `gap-0.5`, `p-0.5` | Micro spacing |\n| 1 | 4px | `gap-1`, `p-1` | Very tight |\n| 2 | 8px | `gap-2`, `p-2` | Tight groups (icon + text) |\n| 3 | 12px | `gap-3`, `p-3` | Compact spacing |\n| 4 | 16px | `gap-4`, `p-4` | Standard spacing (DEFAULT) |\n| 6 | 24px | `gap-6`, `p-6` | Comfortable spacing |\n| 8 | 32px | `gap-8`, `p-8` | Generous spacing |\n| 12 | 48px | `gap-12`, `p-12` | Section breaks |\n| 16 | 64px | `gap-16`, `p-16` | Major divisions |\n\n### Component Internal Spacing (gap)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Icon + Text (tight)

(justify) -->\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n  <h2>Title</h2>\n  <button>Action</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Container Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Page Container (max-width) -->\n<div class=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Section Container (breathing room) -->\n<section class=\"py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-24\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</section>\n\n<!-- Card Container -->\n<div class=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n  <!-- Centered card -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Spacing Decision Tree\n\n**Use `gap-2`:** Icon + text, tight button groups  \n**Use `gap-4`:** Form fields, related elements (DEFAULT)  \n**Use `gap-6`:** Card sections, distinct groups  \n**Use `gap-8`:** Major page sections  \n**Use `gap-12`+:** Hero sections, full-page breaks\n\n**Padding hierarchy:**  \n`p-4` → Mobile/compact  \n`p-6` → Standard (DEFAULT)  \n`p-8` → Spacious/desktop\n\n**Margin hierarchy:**  \n`mb-4` → Between elements  \n`mb-6` → Between groups  \n`mb-8` → Between sections  \n`mb-12`+ → Between major blocks\n```\n\n### 3.5 Icon System\n\n```markdown\n## Icon System Guidelines\n\n### Icon Library\n\n**Recommended:** Lucide Icons (clean,

</template>\n</Card>\n```\n\n### Scoped Slots (Data Passing)\n\n```vue\n<!-- DataList.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  items: Array<any>\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n    <div\n      v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n      :key=\"item.id\"\n    >\n      <slot :item=\"item\" :index=\"index\"

</template>\n</DataList>\n```\n\n### Fallback Content Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Alert.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.icon\" class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <slot name=\"icon\" />\n    </div>\n    <div v-else class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <!-- Default icon -->\n      <AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"alert-content\">\n      <slot>\n        <!-- Fallback if no content provided -->\n        <p>No message provided</p>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Conditional Slots Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Modal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useSlots } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst hasActions = computed(() => !!slots.actions)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div

When to Use Slots\n\n**Use slots when:**\n- ✅ Content structure varies significantly\n- ✅ Parent needs control over rendering\n- ✅ Building flexible, reusable components\n- ✅ Creating compound components (Card, Modal, Tabs)\n\n**Use props when:**\n- ✅ Data is simple (strings, numbers, booleans)\n- ✅ Component has fixed structure\n- ✅ Configuration over composition\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Part

Context is precious.\n\n**Always /clear when:**\n```bash\n# After completing any feature\ngit commit -m \"Add authentication system\"\n/clear\n\n# Before starting unrelated tasks\n/clear\n\"Now let's work on the email notification system\"\n\n# When switching between unrelated areas\n# Example: Frontend → Backend → DevOps\n/clear\n\"Switch to backend API development\"\n\n# When Claude seems confused or loops\n/clear\n\"Let's start fresh. Here's what I need...\"\n\n# Before visual regression tests (reset mental model)\n/clear\n/ui-visual-regression [component-path]\n```\n\n**Don't /clear when:**\n- Mid-feature implementation\n- Iterating on same component\n- Following multi-step plan\n- Claude is actively debugging\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If your next prompt is unrelated to the last 5 messages, /clear first.\n\n---\n\n### Task Planning: .temp Folder\n\nFor complex multi-step tasks, externalize planning to save context for execution.\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```bash\n.temp/\n├── REFACTOR_PAD.md      # Current refactor planning\n├── DASHBOARD_PAD.md     # Dashboard feature planning\n├── MIGRATION_PAD.md     # Migration planning\n└── [TASK]_PAD.md        # Any task-specific scratchpad\n```\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n```bash\n# Start complex task\n\"Plan the provider pattern refactor in .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\"\n\n# Claude creates structured plan:\n## Task: Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n### Analysis\n- Current state: 57 duplicate platform components\n- What needs to change: Consolidate to BaseProviderCard + config\n- Potential issues: Testing, migration path\n\n### Plan\n1. Create BaseProviderCard component with slot system\n2. Create providers.ts configuration\n3. Migrate Facebook components (test)\n4. Migrate remaining platforms\n5. Remove deprecated files\n\n### Files to Modify\n- src/components/vue/base/BaseProviderCard.vue (NEW)\n- src/config/providers.ts (NEW)\n- src/components/vue/cards/FacebookCard.vue (REFACTOR)\n- [... 56 more files]\n\n### Validation\n- [ ] All platforms render correctly\n- [ ] Props pass through properly\n- [ ] Visual regression tests pass\n- [ ] Console errors clear\n\n# Review and approve\n\"Looks good, proceed with step 1\"\n\n# Claude executes step 1\n\n# Continue iteratively\n\"Show me what changed, then move to step 2\"\n\n# When complete, cleanup\nrm .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Planning is explicit and reviewable\n- Can pause/resume at any step\n- Context focused on execution, not planning\n- Can /clear between steps without losing plan\n- Works for ANY complex task\n\n**Examples across workflows:**\n```bash\n# Component refactor\n\"Plan the modal redesign in .temp/MODAL_PAD.md\"\n\n# Multi-file change\n\"Plan the authentication flow in .temp/AUTH_PAD.md\"\n\n# Migration\n\"Plan the Tailwind v4 upgrade in .temp/UPGRADE_PAD.md\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Permanent Decisions: .claude/decisions.md\n\nFor architectural decisions that should persist across sessions.\n\n**Create:** `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**Only document:**\n- Technology choices (why X over Y)\n- Architecture patterns (why we structure things this way)\n- Breaking changes (what changed and why)\n- Failed approaches (so Claude doesn't retry them)\n\n**Format:**\n```markdown\n## [Decision Name] - [YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n**Context:** What prompted this decision\n**Decision:** What we decided to do\n**Reasoning:** Why we made this choice\n**Alternatives Considered:** What we didn't choose and why\n**Impact:** What this affects\n\n---\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Nanostore Over Pinia - 2025-10-15\n\n**Context:** Need global state management for user auth and theme\n\n**Decision:** Use Nanostore instead of Pinia\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Lighter weight (1kb vs 10kb)\n- Framework agnostic (works with Astro pages)\n- Simpler API for our use case\n- No Vue-specific coupling\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Pinia: Too heavy, Vue-specific\n- Vuex: Deprecated\n- Context/Provide: Doesn't work across Astro boundaries\n\n**Impact:** All global state uses Nanostore atoms\n\n---\n```\n\n**When to add:**\n- Once per major decision\n- Not for every component choice\n- Focus on \"why\" not \"what\"\n\n---\n\n# Part 2: Core Design Principles\n\n> **Benefit:** Professional UI quality, consistent visual language\n> **Add to:** Project CLAUDE.md\n\n## 🎨 UI Design Principles\n\n### Depth Through Shadows & Color Layering\n\n**Problem:** Borders make UIs look flat and dated.\n\n**Solution:** Use shadows and color layering to create depth.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. Generate 3-4 shades for each base color\n2. Darker shades = background layers\n3. Lighter shades = foreground elements\n4. Eliminate borders where possible\n5. Use dual-shadow system (light + dark)\n\n**Shadow System:**\n```css\n/* Three-tier shadow system */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);           /* Subtle elevation */\n--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),\n             0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);            /* Standard cards */\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n             0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);             /* Modals, popovers */\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15),\n             0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);           /* Hero sections */\n```\n\n**Tailwind pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Old: Borders -->\n<div class=\"border border-gray-300 rounded-lg\">\n\n<!-- ✅ New: Shadows + Color Layers -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 shadow-md rounded-lg\">\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg p-6\">\n    <!-- Content on lighter bg = elevated -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Color layering pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- Page → Section → Card → Content -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50\">              <!-- Darkest (page bg) -->\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-100 shadow-sm\">  <!-- Section bg -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white shadow-md\">   <!-- Card bg -->\n      <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-4\">     <!-- Elevated content -->\n        <!-- Lightest = highest elevation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**When borders ARE okay:**\n- Input fields (functional affordance)\n- Focus states (accessibility requirement)\n- Table cells (data separation)\n- Dividers (semantic separation)\n\n**Prompt pattern for Claude:**\n\"Use shadow-md and color layering (bg-gray-50/100) for depth. Avoid borders except for inputs and focus states.\"\n\n---\n\n### Semantic Color Palette System\n\n**Define 4 color types before any design work:**\n\n1. **Primary** — CTAs, key actions, brand identity\n2. **Secondary** — Subtle highlights, accents, secondary actions\n3. **Neutral** — Backgrounds, text, UI chrome (grays)\n4. **Semantic** — States (success, warning, error, info)\n\n**Token structure:**\n```css\n/* Primary (Brand) */\n--color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n--color-primary-500: #ef4444;   /* Base - buttons, links */\n--color-primary-600: #dc2626;   /* Hover state */\n--color-primary-700: #b91c1c;   /* Active state */\n--color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n\n/* Secondary (Accent) */\n--color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n--color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;  /* Base */\n--color-secondary-600: #0d9488;  /* Hover */\n\n/* Neutral (Grays) */\n--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;    /* Page background */\n--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;   /* Section background */\n--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;   /* Card background */\n--color-neutral-300: #d4d4d4;   /* Input borders */\n--color-neutral-400: #a3a3a3;   /* Disabled text */\n--color-neutral-500: #737373;   /* Secondary text */\n--color-neutral-700: #404040;   /* Body text */\n--color-neutral-900: #171717;   /* Headings */\n\n/* Semantic (States) */\n--color-success-50: #f0fdf4;\n--color-success-500: #22c55e;   /* Success messages */\n--color-warning-50: #fffbeb;\n--color-warning-500: #f59e0b;   /* Warning messages */\n--color-error-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-error-500: #ef4444;     /* Error messages */\n--color-info-50: #eff6ff;\n--color-info-500: #3b82f6;      /* Info messages */\n```\n\n**Usage rules:**\n- Primary: 1-2 uses per screen (CTAs only)\n- Secondary: Supporting actions, badges, highlights\n- Neutral: Everything else (80% of UI)\n- Semantic: State feedback only (not decoration)\n\n**Tailwind mapping:**\n```vue\n<!-- Primary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700\">\n\n<!-- Secondary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600\">\n\n<!-- Backgrounds (depth layering) -->\n<div class=\"bg-neutral-50\">        <!-- Page -->\n  <div class=\"bg-neutral-100\">     <!-- Section -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white\">         <!-- Card -->\n\n<!-- Semantic states -->\n<div class=\"bg-success-50 text-success-700 border border-success-200\">\n  ✓ Success message\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Mobile-First: Priority Rearrangement\n\n**Problem:** Treating responsive as \"make it smaller\" produces bad mobile UX.\n\n**Solution:** Reorganize by priority on mobile, don't just shrink.\n\n**Priority system:**\n1. **Critical** — Primary action, key info (always visible)\n2. **Important** — Secondary actions, supporting content (visible but demoted)\n3. **Optional** — Tertiary features, extra info (collapsed/hidden)\n\n**Desktop vs Mobile structure:**\n```vue\n<!-- Desktop: Side-by-side layout -->\n<div class=\"lg:flex lg:gap-8\">\n  <aside class=\"lg:w-64\">\n    <!-- Filters, secondary nav -->\n  </aside>\n  <main class=\"lg:flex-1\">\n    <!-- Primary content -->\n  </main>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: Stacked by priority -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <!-- 1.

adding animations:\n- [ ] Duration is 150-300ms (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using `opacity` or `transform` (not width/height)\n- [ ] Easing is appropriate (ease-out for most)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show)\n\n---\n\n## Spatial Rhythm System\n\n### Core Spacing Scale (Tailwind)\n\n**Use ONLY these values:** 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4,

elements (DEFAULT)\n**Use `gap-6`:** Card sections, distinct groups\n**Use `gap-8`:** Major page sections\n**Use `gap-12`+:** Hero sections, full-page breaks\n\n**Padding hierarchy:**\n`p-4` → Mobile/compact\n`p-6` → Standard (DEFAULT)\n`p-8` → Spacious/desktop\n\n**Margin hierarchy:**\n`mb-4` → Between elements\n`mb-6` → Between groups\n`mb-8` → Between sections\n`mb-12`+ → Between major blocks\n\n---\n\n## Icon System Guidelines\n\n### Icon Library\n\n**Recommended:** Lucide Icons (clean, consistent, MIT licensed)\n\n```bash\nnpm install lucide-vue-next\n```\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ChevronRight, User, Settings } from 'lucide-vue-next'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <ChevronRight :size=\"20\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n### Icon Sizing\n\n| Size | Pixels | Use Case |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| 16px | `w-4 h-4` | Inline with `text-sm` |\n| 20px | `w-5 h-5` | Inline with `text-base` (MOST COMMON) |\n| 24px | `w-6 h-6` | Buttons, standalone icons |\n| 32px | `w-8 h-8` | Large buttons, features |\n| 48px+ | `w-12 h-12` | Hero sections, empty states |\n\n### Icon + Text Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Button with icon -->\n<button class=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n  <ChevronRight class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n  <span>Next Step</span>\n</button>\n\n<!-- Input with icon -->\n<div class=\"relative\">\n  <Search class=\"absolute left-3 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-5 h-5 text-neutral-400\" />\n  <input class=\"pl-10\" />\n</div>\n\n<!-- List item with icon -->\n<div class=\"flex items-start gap-3\">\n  <CheckCircle class=\"w-5 h-5 text-success-500 flex-shrink-0 mt-0.5\" />\n  <p>Completed task description</p>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Card with icon -->\n<div class=\"flex items-center gap-4\">\n  <div class=\"w-12 h-12 bg-primary-100 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center\">\n    <User class=\"w-6 h-6 text-primary-600\" />\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h3>User Profile</h3>\n    <p>Manage your account</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Icon Accessibility\n\n```vue\n<!-- Decorative icon (no meaning) -->\n<ChevronRight class=\"w-5 h-5\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n\n<!-- Semantic icon (conveys meaning) -->\n<button>\n  <X class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n  <span class=\"sr-only\">Close</span>\n</button>\n\n<!-- Icon with visible text (no sr-only needed) -->\n<button class=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n  <Trash class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n  <span>Delete</span>\n</button>\n```\n\n### Icon Color Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Inherit text color (default) -->\n<User class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n\n<!-- Explicit color -->\n<CheckCircle class=\"w-5 h-5 text-success-500\" />\n<AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5 text-warning-500\" />\n<XCircle class=\"w-5 h-5 text-error-500\" />\n\n<!-- Hover state -->\n<button class=\"group\">\n  <Settings class=\"w-5 h-5 text-neutral-500 group-hover:text-primary-600 transition-colors\" />\n</button>\n```\n\n### Icon Button Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Standard icon button -->\n<button class=\"\n  w-10 h-10\n  flex items-center justify-center\n  rounded-lg\n  hover:bg-neutral-100\n  focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary-500\n  transition-colors\n\" aria-label=\"Settings\">\n  <Settings class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n</button>\n\n<!-- Icon button with tooltip -->\n<button\n  class=\"w-10 h-10 rounded-lg hover:bg-neutral-100\"\n  aria-label=\"Delete\"\n  title=\"Delete item\"\n>\n  <Trash class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flexible Component Composition (Vue Slots)\n\n### Basic Slot Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Card.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ndefineOptions({ name: 'Card' })\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-6\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.header\" class=\"mb-4 pb-4 border-b border-neutral-200\">\n      <slot name=\"header\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n      <slot />  <!-- Default slot -->\n    </div>\n\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.footer\" class=\"mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-neutral-200\">\n      <slot name=\"footer\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Usage -->\n<Card>\n  <template #header>\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold\">Card Title</h3>\n  </template>\n\n  <p>Card body content here</p>\n\n  <template #footer>\n    <button>Action</button>\n  </template>\n</Card>\n```\n\n### Scoped Slots (Data Passing)\n\n```vue\n<!-- DataList.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  items: Array<any>\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n    <div\n      v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n      :key=\"item.id\"\n    >\n      <slot :item=\"item\" :index=\"index\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Usage -->\n<DataList :items=\"users\">\n  <template #default=\"{ item, index }\">\n    <UserCard :user=\"item\" :position=\"index + 1\" />\n  </template>\n</DataList>\n```\n\n### Fallback Content Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Alert.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.icon\" class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <slot name=\"icon\" />\n    </div>\n    <div v-else class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <!-- Default icon -->\n      <AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"alert-content\">\n      <slot>\n        <!-- Fallback if no content provided -->\n        <p>No message provided</p>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Conditional Slots Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Modal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useSlots } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst hasActions = computed(() => !!slots.actions)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"modal\">\n    <!-- Header (optional) -->\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.header\" class=\"modal-header\">\n      <slot name=\"header\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Body (required) -->\n    <div class=\"modal-body\">\n      <slot />\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Actions (conditional styling) -->\n    <div\n      v-if=\"hasActions\"\n      class=\"modal-footer flex justify-end gap-3\"\n    >\n      <slot name=\"actions\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Render Function Slots (Advanced)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Tabs.vue (renderless pattern) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref, provide } from 'vue'\n\nconst activeTab = ref(0)\n\nprovide('tabsContext', {\n  activeTab,\n  setActive: (index: number) => activeTab.value = index\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"tabs\">\n    <div class=\"tab-list\">\n      <slot name=\"tabs\" />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tab-panels\">\n      <slot name=\"panels\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### When to Use Slots\n\n**Use slots when:**\n- ✅ Content structure varies significantly\n- ✅ Parent needs control over rendering\n- ✅ Building flexible, reusable components\n- ✅ Creating compound components (Card, Modal, Tabs)\n\n**Use props when:**\n- ✅ Data is simple (strings, numbers, booleans)\n- ✅ Component has fixed structure\n- ✅ Configuration over composition\n\n---\n\n# Additional Implementation Files\n\n## CSS Token Updates (design-system.css)\n\nAdd these sections to your

Setup Instructions\n\n### Phase 1: Directory Setup (5 minutes)\n\n```bash\n# Create required directories\nmkdir -p .temp\ntouch .claude/decisions.md\n\n# Add to .gitignore\necho \".temp/\" >> .gitignore\necho \"SCRATCHPAD.md\" >> .gitignore\necho \"*_PAD.md\" >> .gitignore\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Testing (10 minutes)\n\n```bash\n# Test context management\n\"Plan a complex refactor in .temp/TEST_PAD.md\"\n# Verify scratchpad creation\n\n/clear\n# Verify context cleared\n\n# Test design principles\n# Create a component and verify:\n# - Shadows render correctly\n# - Semantic colors work\n# - Mobile responsiveness functions properly\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference Card\n\n### Most Important Patterns\n\n**Context Management:**\n- Complex task? → `.temp/[TASK]_PAD.md`\n- Finished feature? → `/clear`\n- Major decision? → `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**UI Design:**\n- Depth → Shadows + color layering (no borders)\n- Colors → Primary/Secondary/Neutral/Semantic\n- Mobile → Reorganize by priority (don't just shrink)\n- States → Hover/Focus/Active/Disabled on everything\n- Motion → 150-300ms, ease-out, respect reduced motion\n\n**Spacing:**\n- `gap-2` → Icon + text\n- `gap-4` → Form fields (DEFAULT)\n- `gap-6` → Card sections\n- `gap-8` → Page sections\n\n**Typography:**\n- Headings → `font-semibold` (600)\n- Body → `font-normal` (400)\n- Labels → `font-medium` (500)\n\n---\n\n##

Context is precious.\n\n**Always /clear when:**\n```bash\n# After completing any feature\ngit commit -m \"Add authentication system\"\n/clear\n\n# Before starting unrelated tasks\n/clear\n\"Now let's work on the email notification system\"\n\n# When switching between unrelated areas\n# Example: Frontend → Backend → DevOps\n/clear\n\"Switch to backend API development\"\n\n# When Claude seems confused or loops\n/clear\n\"Let's start fresh. Here's what I need...\"\n\n# Before visual regression tests (reset mental model)\n/clear\n/ui-visual-regression [component-path]\n```\n\n**Don't /clear when:**\n- Mid-feature implementation\n- Iterating on same component\n- Following multi-step plan\n- Claude is actively debugging\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If your next prompt is unrelated to the last 5 messages, /clear first.\n\n---\n\n### Task Planning: .temp Folder\n\nFor complex multi-step tasks, externalize planning to save context for execution.\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```bash\n.temp/\n├── REFACTOR_PAD.md      # Current refactor planning\n├── DASHBOARD_PAD.md     # Dashboard feature planning\n├── MIGRATION_PAD.md     # Migration planning\n└── [TASK]_PAD.md        # Any task-specific scratchpad\n```\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n```bash\n# Start complex task\n\"Plan the provider pattern refactor in .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\"\n\n# Claude creates structured plan:\n## Task: Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n### Analysis\n- Current state: 57 duplicate platform components\n- What needs to change: Consolidate to BaseProviderCard + config\n- Potential issues: Testing, migration path\n\n### Plan\n1. Create BaseProviderCard component with slot system\n2. Create providers.ts configuration\n3. Migrate Facebook components (test)\n4. Migrate remaining platforms\n5. Remove deprecated files\n\n### Files to Modify\n- src/components/vue/base/BaseProviderCard.vue (NEW)\n- src/config/providers.ts (NEW)\n- src/components/vue/cards/FacebookCard.vue (REFACTOR)\n- [... 56 more files]\n\n### Validation\n- [ ] All platforms render correctly\n- [ ] Props pass through properly\n- [ ] Visual regression tests pass\n- [ ] Console errors clear\n\n# Review and approve\n\"Looks good, proceed with step 1\"\n\n# Claude executes step 1\n\n# Continue iteratively\n\"Show me what changed, then move to step 2\"\n\n# When complete, cleanup\nrm .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Planning is explicit and reviewable\n- Can pause/resume at any step\n- Context focused on execution, not planning\n- Can /clear between steps without losing plan\n- Works for ANY complex task\n\n**Examples across workflows:**\n```bash\n# Component refactor\n\"Plan the modal redesign in .temp/MODAL_PAD.md\"\n\n# Multi-file change\n\"Plan the authentication flow in .temp/AUTH_PAD.md\"\n\n# Migration\n\"Plan the Tailwind v4 upgrade in .temp/UPGRADE_PAD.md\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### Permanent Decisions: .claude/decisions.md\n\nFor architectural decisions that should persist across sessions.\n\n**Create:** `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**Only document:**\n- Technology choices (why X over Y)\n- Architecture patterns (why we structure things this way)\n- Breaking changes (what changed and why)\n- Failed approaches (so Claude doesn't retry them)\n\n**Format:**\n```markdown\n## [Decision Name] - [YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n**Context:** What prompted this decision\n**Decision:** What we decided to do\n**Reasoning:** Why we made this choice\n**Alternatives Considered:** What we didn't choose and why\n**Impact:** What this affects\n\n---\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Nanostore Over Pinia - 2025-10-15\n\n**Context:** Need global state management for user auth and theme\n\n**Decision:** Use Nanostore instead of Pinia\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Lighter weight (1kb vs 10kb)\n- Framework agnostic (works with Astro pages)\n- Simpler API for our use case\n- No Vue-specific coupling\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Pinia: Too heavy, Vue-specific\n- Vuex: Deprecated\n- Context/Provide: Doesn't work across Astro boundaries\n\n**Impact:** All global state uses Nanostore atoms\n\n---\n```\n\n**When to add:**\n- Once per major decision\n- Not for every component choice\n- Focus on \"why\" not \"what\"\n\n---\n\n# Part 2: Core Design Principles\n\n> **Benefit:** Professional UI quality, consistent visual language\n> **Add to:** Project CLAUDE.md\n\n## 🎨 UI Design Principles\n\n### Depth Through Shadows & Color Layering\n\n**Problem:** Borders make UIs look flat and dated.\n\n**Solution:** Use shadows and color layering to create depth.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. Generate 3-4 shades for each base color\n2. Darker shades = background layers\n3. Lighter shades = foreground elements\n4. Eliminate borders where possible\n5. Use dual-shadow system (light + dark)\n\n**Shadow System:**\n```css\n/* Three-tier shadow system */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);           /* Subtle elevation */\n--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),\n             0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);            /* Standard cards */\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n             0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);             /* Modals, popovers */\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15),\n             0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);           /* Hero sections */\n```\n\n**Tailwind pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Old: Borders -->\n<div class=\"border border-gray-300 rounded-lg\">\n\n<!-- ✅ New: Shadows + Color Layers -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 shadow-md rounded-lg\">\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg p-6\">\n    <!-- Content on lighter bg = elevated -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Color layering pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- Page → Section → Card → Content -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50\">              <!-- Darkest (page bg) -->\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-100 shadow-sm\">  <!-- Section bg -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white shadow-md\">   <!-- Card bg -->\n      <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-4\">     <!-- Elevated content -->\n        <!-- Lightest = highest elevation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**When borders ARE okay:**\n- Input fields (functional affordance)\n- Focus states (accessibility requirement)\n- Table cells (data separation)\n- Dividers (semantic separation)\n\n**Prompt pattern for Claude:**\n\"Use shadow-md and color layering (bg-gray-50/100) for depth. Avoid borders except for inputs and focus states.\"\n\n---\n\n### Semantic Color Palette System\n\n**Define 4 color types before any design work:**\n\n1. **Primary** — CTAs, key actions, brand identity\n2. **Secondary** — Subtle highlights, accents, secondary actions\n3. **Neutral** — Backgrounds, text, UI chrome (grays)\n4. **Semantic** — States (success, warning, error, info)\n\n**Token structure:**\n```css\n/* Primary (Brand) */\n--color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n--color-primary-500: #ef4444;   /* Base - buttons, links */\n--color-primary-600: #dc2626;   /* Hover state */\n--color-primary-700: #b91c1c;   /* Active state */\n--color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n\n/* Secondary (Accent) */\n--color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n--color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;  /* Base */\n--color-secondary-600: #0d9488;  /* Hover */\n\n/* Neutral (Grays) */\n--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;    /* Page background */\n--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;   /* Section background */\n--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;   /* Card background */\n--color-neutral-300: #d4d4d4;   /* Input borders */\n--color-neutral-400: #a3a3a3;   /* Disabled text */\n--color-neutral-500: #737373;   /* Secondary text */\n--color-neutral-700: #404040;   /* Body text */\n--color-neutral-900: #171717;   /* Headings */\n\n/* Semantic (States) */\n--color-success-50: #f0fdf4;\n--color-success-500: #22c55e;   /* Success messages */\n--color-warning-50: #fffbeb;\n--color-warning-500: #f59e0b;   /* Warning messages */\n--color-error-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-error-500: #ef4444;     /* Error messages */\n--color-info-50: #eff6ff;\n--color-info-500: #3b82f6;      /* Info messages */\n```\n\n**Usage rules:**\n- Primary: 1-2 uses per screen (CTAs only)\n- Secondary: Supporting actions, badges, highlights\n- Neutral: Everything else (80% of UI)\n- Semantic: State feedback only (not decoration)\n\n**Tailwind mapping:**\n```vue\n<!-- Primary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700\">\n\n<!-- Secondary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600\">\n\n<!-- Backgrounds (depth layering) -->\n<div class=\"bg-neutral-50\">        <!-- Page -->\n  <div class=\"bg-neutral-100\">     <!-- Section -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white\">         <!-- Card -->\n\n<!-- Semantic states -->\n<div class=\"bg-success-50 text-success-700 border border-success-200\">\n  ✓ Success message\n</div>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Mobile-First: Priority Rearrangement\n\n**Problem:** Treating responsive as \"make it smaller\" produces bad mobile UX.\n\n**Solution:** Reorganize by priority on mobile, don't just shrink.\n\n**Priority system:**\n1. **Critical** — Primary action, key info (always visible)\n2. **Important** — Secondary actions, supporting content (visible but demoted)\n3. **Optional** — Tertiary features, extra info (collapsed/hidden)\n\n**Desktop vs Mobile structure:**\n```vue\n<!-- Desktop: Side-by-side layout -->\n<div class=\"lg:flex lg:gap-8\">\n  <aside class=\"lg:w-64\">\n    <!-- Filters, secondary nav -->\n  </aside>\n  <main class=\"lg:flex-1\">\n    <!-- Primary content -->\n  </main>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: Stacked by priority -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <!-- 1.

adding animations:\n- [ ] Duration is 150-300ms (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using `opacity` or `transform` (not width/height)\n- [ ] Easing is appropriate (ease-out for most)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show)\n\n---\n\n## Spatial Rhythm System\n\n### Core Spacing Scale (Tailwind)\n\n**Use ONLY these values:** 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4,

elements (DEFAULT)\n**Use `gap-6`:** Card sections, distinct groups\n**Use `gap-8`:** Major page sections\n**Use `gap-12`+:** Hero sections, full-page breaks\n\n**Padding hierarchy:**\n`p-4` → Mobile/compact\n`p-6` → Standard (DEFAULT)\n`p-8` → Spacious/desktop\n\n**Margin hierarchy:**\n`mb-4` → Between elements\n`mb-6` → Between groups\n`mb-8` → Between sections\n`mb-12`+ → Between major blocks\n\n---\n\n## Icon System Guidelines\n\n### Icon Library\n\n**Recommended:** Lucide Icons (clean, consistent, MIT licensed)\n\n```bash\nnpm install lucide-vue-next\n```\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ChevronRight, User, Settings } from 'lucide-vue-next'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <ChevronRight :size=\"20\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n### Icon Sizing\n\n| Size | Pixels | Use Case |\n|------|--------|----------|\n| 16px | `w-4 h-4` | Inline with `text-sm` |\n| 20px | `w-5 h-5` | Inline with `text-base` (MOST COMMON) |\n| 24px | `w-6 h-6` | Buttons, standalone icons |\n| 32px | `w-8 h-8` | Large buttons, features |\n| 48px+ | `w-12 h-12` | Hero sections, empty states |\n\n### Icon + Text Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Button with icon -->\n<button class=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n  <ChevronRight class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n  <span>Next Step</span>\n</button>\n\n<!-- Input with icon -->\n<div class=\"relative\">\n  <Search class=\"absolute left-3 top-1/2 -translate-y-1/2 w-5 h-5 text-neutral-400\" />\n  <input class=\"pl-10\" />\n</div>\n\n<!-- List item with icon -->\n<div class=\"flex items-start gap-3\">\n  <CheckCircle class=\"w-5 h-5 text-success-500 flex-shrink-0 mt-0.5\" />\n  <p>Completed task description</p>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Card with icon -->\n<div class=\"flex items-center gap-4\">\n  <div class=\"w-12 h-12 bg-primary-100 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center\">\n    <User class=\"w-6 h-6 text-primary-600\" />\n  </div>\n  <div>\n    <h3>User Profile</h3>\n    <p>Manage your account</p>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Icon Accessibility\n\n```vue\n<!-- Decorative icon (no meaning) -->\n<ChevronRight class=\"w-5 h-5\" aria-hidden=\"true\" />\n\n<!-- Semantic icon (conveys meaning) -->\n<button>\n  <X class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n  <span class=\"sr-only\">Close</span>\n</button>\n\n<!-- Icon with visible text (no sr-only needed) -->\n<button class=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n  <Trash class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n  <span>Delete</span>\n</button>\n```\n\n### Icon Color Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Inherit text color (default) -->\n<User class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n\n<!-- Explicit color -->\n<CheckCircle class=\"w-5 h-5 text-success-500\" />\n<AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5 text-warning-500\" />\n<XCircle class=\"w-5 h-5 text-error-500\" />\n\n<!-- Hover state -->\n<button class=\"group\">\n  <Settings class=\"w-5 h-5 text-neutral-500 group-hover:text-primary-600 transition-colors\" />\n</button>\n```\n\n### Icon Button Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Standard icon button -->\n<button class=\"\n  w-10 h-10\n  flex items-center justify-center\n  rounded-lg\n  hover:bg-neutral-100\n  focus:ring-2 focus:ring-primary-500\n  transition-colors\n\" aria-label=\"Settings\">\n  <Settings class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n</button>\n\n<!-- Icon button with tooltip -->\n<button\n  class=\"w-10 h-10 rounded-lg hover:bg-neutral-100\"\n  aria-label=\"Delete\"\n  title=\"Delete item\"\n>\n  <Trash class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n</button>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Flexible Component Composition (Vue Slots)\n\n### Basic Slot Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Card.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ndefineOptions({ name: 'Card' })\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-xl shadow-md p-6\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.header\" class=\"mb-4 pb-4 border-b border-neutral-200\">\n      <slot name=\"header\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n      <slot />  <!-- Default slot -->\n    </div>\n\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.footer\" class=\"mt-4 pt-4 border-t border-neutral-200\">\n      <slot name=\"footer\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Usage -->\n<Card>\n  <template #header>\n    <h3 class=\"text-xl font-semibold\">Card Title</h3>\n  </template>\n\n  <p>Card body content here</p>\n\n  <template #footer>\n    <button>Action</button>\n  </template>\n</Card>\n```\n\n### Scoped Slots (Data Passing)\n\n```vue\n<!-- DataList.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  items: Array<any>\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n    <div\n      v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n      :key=\"item.id\"\n    >\n      <slot :item=\"item\" :index=\"index\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Usage -->\n<DataList :items=\"users\">\n  <template #default=\"{ item, index }\">\n    <UserCard :user=\"item\" :position=\"index + 1\" />\n  </template>\n</DataList>\n```\n\n### Fallback Content Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Alert.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.icon\" class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <slot name=\"icon\" />\n    </div>\n    <div v-else class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <!-- Default icon -->\n      <AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"alert-content\">\n      <slot>\n        <!-- Fallback if no content provided -->\n        <p>No message provided</p>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Conditional Slots Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Modal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useSlots } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst hasActions = computed(() => !!slots.actions)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"modal\">\n    <!-- Header (optional) -->\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.header\" class=\"modal-header\">\n      <slot name=\"header\" />\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Body (required) -->\n    <div class=\"modal-body\">\n      <slot />\n    </div>\n\n    <!-- Actions (conditional styling) -->\n    <div\n      v-if=\"hasActions\"\n      class=\"modal-footer flex justify-end gap-3\"\n    >\n      <slot name=\"actions\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Render Function Slots (Advanced)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Tabs.vue (renderless pattern) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref, provide } from 'vue'\n\nconst activeTab = ref(0)\n\nprovide('tabsContext', {\n  activeTab,\n  setActive: (index: number) => activeTab.value = index\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"tabs\">\n    <div class=\"tab-list\">\n      <slot name=\"tabs\" />\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"tab-panels\">\n      <slot name=\"panels\" />\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### When to Use Slots\n\n**Use slots when:**\n- ✅ Content structure varies significantly\n- ✅ Parent needs control over rendering\n- ✅ Building flexible, reusable components\n- ✅ Creating compound components (Card, Modal, Tabs)\n\n**Use props when:**\n- ✅ Data is simple (strings, numbers, booleans)\n- ✅ Component has fixed structure\n- ✅ Configuration over composition\n\n---\n\n# Additional Implementation Files\n\n## CSS Token Updates (design-system.css)\n\nAdd these sections to your

Setup Instructions\n\n### Phase 1: Directory Setup (5 minutes)\n\n```bash\n# Create required directories\nmkdir -p .temp\ntouch .claude/decisions.md\n\n# Add to .gitignore\necho \".temp/\" >> .gitignore\necho \"SCRATCHPAD.md\" >> .gitignore\necho \"*_PAD.md\" >> .gitignore\n```\n\n### Phase 2: Testing (10 minutes)\n\n```bash\n# Test context management\n\"Plan a complex refactor in .temp/TEST_PAD.md\"\n# Verify scratchpad creation\n\n/clear\n# Verify context cleared\n\n# Test design principles\n# Create a component and verify:\n# - Shadows render correctly\n# - Semantic colors work\n# - Mobile responsiveness functions properly\n```\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference Card\n\n### Most Important Patterns\n\n**Context Management:**\n- Complex task? → `.temp/[TASK]_PAD.md`\n- Finished feature? → `/clear`\n- Major decision? → `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**UI Design:**\n- Depth → Shadows + color layering (no borders)\n- Colors → Primary/Secondary/Neutral/Semantic\n- Mobile → Reorganize by priority (don't just shrink)\n- States → Hover/Focus/Active/Disabled on everything\n- Motion → 150-300ms, ease-out, respect reduced motion\n\n**Spacing:**\n- `gap-2` → Icon + text\n- `gap-4` → Form fields (DEFAULT)\n- `gap-6` → Card sections\n- `gap-8` → Page sections\n\n**Typography:**\n- Headings → `font-semibold` (600)\n- Body → `font-normal` (400)\n- Labels → `font-medium` (500)\n\n---\n\n##

Design Token Analysis\n- Extract and validate CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n- Identify color schemes, spacing scales, typography systems\n- Detect token usage patterns across components\n- Flag hardcoded values that should use tokens\n\n### 2. Pattern Recognition\n- Search for similar existing components before creation\n- Identify composition opportunities\n- Detect duplication and suggest consolidation\n- Recognize provider patterns and reusable abstractions\n\n### 3. Design System Compliance\n- Validate components use only design tokens\n- Check for Tailwind utility class compliance\n- Identify @apply violations and inline styles\n- Ensure consistent naming conventions\n\n### 4. Token Management\n- Add new tokens to design-system.css when justified\n- Maintain token naming consistency\n- Document token usage and relationships\n- Suggest token deprecation when appropriate\n\n### 5. Design Quality Scoring\n- Analyze components against depth, typography, motion, and interactive state standards\n- Calculate quality scores for professional UI polish\n- Provide actionable recommendations for improvements\n- Report comprehensive design quality metrics\n\n## Context Discovery Process\n\nWhen invoked, ALWAYS:\n\n1. **Read design-system.css** (`src/styles/design-system.css`)\n   - Extract current token definitions\n   - Understand color system and scales\n   - Note spacing and typography tokens\n\n2. **Search component directory** (`src/components/vue/`)\n   ```bash\n   find src/components/vue -name \"*.vue\" | head -20\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for similar patterns**\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"class.*{pattern}\" src/components/vue/\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for duplication**\n   - Look for platform-specific components\n   - Identify repeated patterns\n   - Suggest provider/composition approach\n\n## Analysis Output Format\n\nProvide analysis in this structure:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 Design Analysis\n\n### Existing Patterns Found\n- [List similar components with file paths]\n- [Composition opportunities identified]\n\n### Design Tokens Required\n- **Colors**: List required tokens\n- **Spacing**: List spacing needs\n- **Typography**: List font/size needs\n- **Missing Tokens**: New tokens to add\n\n### Compliance Issues\n- ❌ Hardcoded values found: [list]\n- ❌ Inline styles detected: [list]\n- ✅ Token usage: [percentage]\n\n### Recommendations\n1. [Reuse existing component X]\n2. [Add tokens: --color-{name}]\n3. [Refactor to provider pattern]\n```\n\n## Enhanced Scoring Metrics\n\n### Depth Score (0-100)\n- Detects border usage vs shadow/color layering\n- Checks for dual-shadow systems\n- Validates elevation hierarchy\n\n**Calculation:**\n- -10 points per border (except inputs/focus)\n- +20 points for shadow usage\n- +10 points for color layering (bg-gray-50/100 pattern)\n- +10 points for consistent shadow scale\n\n### Typography Score (0-100)\n- Validates font size scale compliance\n- Checks font weight appropriateness\n- Verifies line-height rules\n- Checks color contrast ratios\n\n**Calculation:**\n- +25 points for consistent font scale\n- +25 points for appropriate weights\n- +25 points for correct line heights\n- +25 points for WCAG AA contrast\n\n### Motion Score (0-100)\n- Checks animation duration appropriateness\n- Validates easing functions\n- Ensures accessible motion (prefers-reduced-motion)\n\n**Calculation:**\n- +40 points for appropriate durations (150-300ms)\n- +30 points for correct easing (ease-out default)\n- +30 points for accessibility support\n\n### Interactive States Score (0-100)\n- Validates presence of all required states\n- Checks focus ring implementation\n- Validates disabled state implementation\n\n**Calculation:**\n- +20 points per required state present (hover, focus, active, disabled)\n- +10 points for proper focus rings\n- +10 points for consistent disabled pattern\n\n### Scoring Report Format\n\n```\n📊 Design Quality Analysis\n\nDepth Score: 85/100\n- ✅ Uses shadow-md for elevation\n- ✅ Color layering (bg-gray-50 → bg-white)\n- ⚠️  Found 2 borders (should use shadows)\n- Recommendation: Replace borders with shadows + color depth\n\nTypography Score: 95/100\n- ✅ Font scale compliance\n- ✅ Appropriate weights (semibold for headings)\n- ✅ WCAG AA contrast (7.2:1 headings, 5.1:1 body)\n- ⚠️  One instance of line-height: 1.3 in body text (should be 1.5)\n\nMotion Score: 80/100\n- ✅ Duration: 200ms (appropriate)\n- ⚠️  Missing ease-out (using default)\n- ⚠️  No prefers-reduced-motion support\n\nInteractive States Score: 90/100\n- ✅ Hover state implemented\n- ✅ Focus ring present (ring-2 ring-primary-500)\n- ✅ Active state (scale-95)\n- ✅ Disabled state (proper styling)\n- ⚠️  Loading state could be improved\n\nOverall Design Score: 87/100 ⭐ GOOD\n\nTop Priority Fixes:\n1. Add prefers-reduced-motion support\n2. Replace borders with shadows\n3. Fix body text line-height\n```\n\n## Design System Rules\n\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n✅ Tailwind utility classes only\n✅ Computed classes for dynamic styling\n✅ Semantic token names (--color-primary, not --color-blue)\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb values\n❌ Inline style attributes\n❌ @apply directives\n❌ Custom px values not in design system\n\n## Token Naming Conventions\n\nFollow these patterns:\n- Colors: `--color-{semantic}-{shade}` (e.g., --color-primary-500)\n- Spacing: Use Tailwind scale (--spacing-4, --spacing-8)\n- Typography: `--font-{family}`, `--text-{size}`\n- Shadows: `--shadow-{size}`\n- Borders: `--border-{size}`\n- Radii: `--radius-{size}`\n\n## Search Strategy\n\n### Before Creating New Components:\n1.

Design System Compliance\n- Validate components use only design tokens\n- Check for Tailwind utility class compliance\n- Identify @apply violations and inline styles\n- Ensure consistent naming conventions\n\n### 4. Token Management\n- Add new tokens to design-system.css when justified\n- Maintain token naming consistency\n- Document token usage and relationships\n- Suggest token deprecation when appropriate\n\n### 5.

Component Generation\n- Create Vue 3 components with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Generate 3 distinct variants for every component request\n- Ensure full TypeScript type safety\n- Follow composition-first patterns\n\n### 2. Design System Integration\n- Use only design tokens from design-system.css\n- Apply pure Tailwind utility classes\n- Implement reactive computed classes\n- Ensure accessibility (ARIA, semantic HTML)\n\n### 3. Code Quality\n- Write production-ready, bug-free code\n- Include proper error handling\n- Optimize for performance\n- Follow project conventions exactly\n\n## Strict Code Patterns\n\n### ALWAYS Use:\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n// Type-only props (NO runtime validation)\ninterface Props {\n  label: string\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary'\n}\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n\n// Computed for reactive Tailwind classes\nimport { computed } from 'vue'\nconst buttonClasses = computed(() => ({\n  'bg-[var(--color-primary-500)]': props.variant === 'primary',\n  'bg-[var(--color-secondary-500)]': props.variant === 'secondary',\n  'hover:bg-[var(--color-primary-600)]': true\n}))\n\n// defineModel for v-model patterns\nconst modelValue = defineModel<string>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button :class=\"buttonClasses\">\n    {{ label }}\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation: `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in `<style>` blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded colors/spacing\n❌ `any` type in TypeScript\n\n## Component Structure Template\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { computed } from 'vue'\n\n// 1.

Component Generation\n- Create Vue 3 components with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Generate 3 distinct variants for every component request\n- Ensure full TypeScript type safety\n- Follow composition-first patterns\n\n### 2. Design System Integration\n- Use only design tokens from design-system.css\n- Apply pure Tailwind utility classes\n- Implement reactive computed classes\n- Ensure accessibility (ARIA, semantic HTML)\n\n### 3. Code Quality\n- Write production-ready, bug-free code\n- Include proper error handling\n- Optimize for performance\n- Follow project conventions exactly\n\n## Strict Code Patterns\n\n### ALWAYS Use:\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n// Type-only props (NO runtime validation)\ninterface Props {\n  label: string\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary'\n}\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n\n// Computed for reactive Tailwind classes\nimport { computed } from 'vue'\nconst buttonClasses = computed(() => ({\n  'bg-[var(--color-primary-500)]': props.variant === 'primary',\n  'bg-[var(--color-secondary-500)]': props.variant === 'secondary',\n  'hover:bg-[var(--color-primary-600)]': true\n}))\n\n// defineModel for v-model patterns\nconst modelValue = defineModel<string>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button :class=\"buttonClasses\">\n    {{ label }}\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation: `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in `<style>` blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded colors/spacing\n❌ `any` type in TypeScript\n\n## Component Structure Template\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { computed } from 'vue'\n\n// 1. Type Definitions\ninterface Props {\n  // Define all props with proper types\n}\n\ninterface Emits {\n  // Define all events\n}\n\n// 2. Props & Emits\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\nconst emit = defineEmits<Emits>()\n\n// 3. Models (if needed)\nconst modelValue = defineModel<string>()\n\n// 4. Composables (if needed)\n// import { useProvider } from '@/composables/useProvider'\n\n// 5. Reactive State\n// const state = reactive({})\n\n// 6. Computed Properties\nconst classes = computed(() => ({\n  // All dynamic classes here\n}))\n\n// 7. Methods\nconst handleClick = () => {\n  emit('click')\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <!-- Semantic HTML with ARIA -->\n  <div :class=\"classes\" role=\"button\" @click=\"handleClick\">\n    <slot />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n## Variant Generation Strategy\n\nFor EVERY component request, generate exactly 3 variants:\n\n### Variant 1: Minimal & Elegant\n- Clean, simple implementation\n- Focus on core functionality\n- Minimal visual embellishments\n- Best for: Simple use cases\n\n### Variant 2: Feature-Rich\n- Additional functionality\n- Enhanced interactions\n- More visual feedback\n- Best for: Complex applications\n\n### Variant 3: Accessible & Performance-Optimized\n- WCAG AAA compliance focus\n- Performance optimizations (v-memo, lazy loading)\n- Full keyboard navigation\n- Screen reader support\n- Best for: Production/enterprise\n\n## Variant Output Format\n\nPresent variants like this:\n\n```markdown\n# Component Variants\n\n## ✨ Variant 1: Minimal & Elegant\n**Best for:** Simple implementations, prototypes\n**Features:** [list key features]\n\n[Code here]\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Variant 2: Feature-Rich\n**Best for:** Complex applications with rich interactions\n**Features:** [list key features]\n\n[Code here]\n\n---\n\n## ♿ Variant 3: Accessible & Optimized\n**Best for:** Production environments, enterprise applications\n**Features:** Full WCAG AAA, optimized performance\n**A11y Features:** [list accessibility features]\n**Performance:** [list optimizations]\n\n[Code here]\n```\n\n## Design Token Usage\n\n### Color Application\n```vue\n<!-- Use CSS custom properties with Tailwind -->\n<div class=\"bg-[var(--color-primary-500)] text-[var(--color-text-primary)]\">\n```\n\n### Spacing\n```vue\n<!-- Use Tailwind scale matching design system -->\n<div class=\"p-4 space-y-2 gap-3\">\n```\n\n### Typography\n```vue\n<p class=\"font-[var(--font-sans)] text-[var(--text-base)]\">\n```\n\n## Accessibility Requirements\n\nEvery component MUST include:\n\n1. **Semantic HTML**: Use proper elements (button, nav, article, etc.)\n2. **ARIA Labels**: When semantic HTML is insufficient\n3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support\n4. **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators\n5. **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px for interactive elements\n6. **Color Contrast**: \n   - Text: 4.5:1 ratio minimum\n   - UI components: 3:1 ratio minimum\n\n## Performance Optimizations\n\n### When to Use:\n- `v-memo` for expensive computed lists\n- `v-once` for static content\n- `defineAsyncComponent` for heavy components\n- `computed()` instead of methods for derived state\n\n### Example:\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { computed, defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\n// Lazy load heavy component\nconst HeavyChart = defineAsyncComponent(() => \n  import('./HeavyChart.vue')\n)\n\n// Memoize expensive list rendering\nconst memoKey = computed(() => [items.value.length, sortOrder.value])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\" v-memo=\"memoKey\">\n    <!-- Expensive rendering -->\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n## File Naming & Location\n\n### Naming Convention:\n- **PascalCase.vue** (e.g., PrimaryButton.vue, UserCard.vue)\n\n### Directory Structure:\n```\nsrc/components/vue/\n├── ui/              # Core design system components\n├── base/            # Foundation components\n├── buttons/         # Button variants\n├── cards/           # Card components\n├── modals/          # Dialogs/modals\n└── inputs/          # Form inputs\n```\n\n## Provider Pattern Integration\n\nFor platform-specific components, use provider pattern:\n\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const providers = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'facebook',\n    color: '--color-facebook'\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Use BaseProviderCard instead of FacebookCard -->\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\" \n  :account=\"accountData\" \n/>\n```\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\nGenerate components that are easily testable:\n- Pure functions for complex logic\n- Props for all inputs\n- Events for all outputs\n- No direct DOM manipulation\n\n## Refinement Process\n\nAfter initial generation:\n\n1. **Round 1 - Polish**:\n   - Review code quality\n   - Enhance TypeScript types\n   - Improve class naming\n   - Add code comments\n\n2. **Round 2 - Performance & A11y**:\n   - Add v-memo where needed\n   - Verify ARIA labels\n   -

Text: 4.5:1 ratio minimum\n   - UI components: 3:1 ratio minimum\n\n## Performance Optimizations\n\n### When to Use:\n- `v-memo` for expensive computed lists\n- `v-once` for static content\n- `defineAsyncComponent` for heavy components\n- `computed()` instead of methods for derived state\n\n### Example:\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { computed, defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\n// Lazy load heavy component\nconst HeavyChart = defineAsyncComponent(() => \n  import('./HeavyChart.vue')\n)\n\n// Memoize expensive list rendering\nconst memoKey = computed(() => [items.value.length, sortOrder.value])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\" v-memo=\"memoKey\">\n    <!-- Expensive rendering -->\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n## File Naming & Location\n\n### Naming Convention:\n- **PascalCase.vue** (e.g., PrimaryButton.vue, UserCard.vue)\n\n### Directory Structure:\n```\nsrc/components/vue/\n├── ui/              # Core design system components\n├── base/            # Foundation components\n├── buttons/         # Button variants\n├── cards/           # Card components\n├── modals/          # Dialogs/modals\n└── inputs/          # Form inputs\n```\n\n## Provider Pattern Integration\n\nFor platform-specific components, use provider pattern:\n\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const providers = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'facebook',\n    color: '--color-facebook'\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Use BaseProviderCard instead of FacebookCard -->\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\" \n  :account=\"accountData\" \n/>\n```\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\nGenerate components that are easily testable:\n- Pure functions for complex logic\n- Props for all inputs\n- Events for all outputs\n- No direct DOM manipulation\n\n## Refinement Process\n\nAfter initial generation:\n\n1. **Round 1 - Polish**:\n   - Review code quality\n   - Enhance TypeScript types\n   - Improve class naming\n   - Add code comments\n\n2. **Round 2 - Performance & A11y**:\n   - Add v-memo where needed\n   - Verify ARIA labels\n   - Check keyboard navigation\n   - Optimize computed properties\n\n## Communication Style\n\n- Provide clear explanations for variant differences\n- Show before/after comparisons when refactoring\n- Highlight key features and trade-offs\n- Be concise but complete\n- Use code examples liberally\n\n## Integration with Other Agents\n\n- **Receive from ui-analyzer**: Design tokens, patterns to follow\n- **Feed to ui-validator**: Generated code for quality checks\n- **Feed to ui-documenter**: Component details for documentation\n\nYou generate production-ready Vue 3 components following strict patterns and always provide 3 variant options.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":316,"oldLines":4,"newStart":316,"newLines":122,"lines":[" -

Validate design system compliance\n\n## Composition Strategies\n\n### Strategy 1: Simple Wrapper\nWrap components in a container with minimal logic:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA.vue'\nimport ComponentB from './ComponentB.vue'\n\ninterface Props {\n  // Combined props from both components\n}\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"composed-wrapper\">\n    <ComponentA :propA=\"props.valueA\" />\n    <ComponentB :propB=\"props.valueB\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Strategy 2: Event Coordination\nComponents interact through parent-coordinated events:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA.vue'\nimport ComponentB from './ComponentB.vue'\n\nconst sharedState = ref('')\n\nconst handleAEvent = (value) => {\n  sharedState.value = value\n  // Update ComponentB\n}\n\nconst handleBEvent = (value) => {\n  // Coordinate with ComponentA\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <ComponentA \n      @update=\"handleAEvent\" \n      :value=\"sharedState\"\n    />\n    <ComponentB \n      @change=\"handleBEvent\"\n      :data=\"sharedState\"\n    />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Strategy 3: Slot-Based Composition\nUse slots for flexible component insertion:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseContainer from './BaseContainer.vue'\nimport HeaderComponent from './HeaderComponent.vue'\nimport ContentComponent from './ContentComponent.vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseContainer>\n    <template #header>\n      <HeaderComponent />\n    </template>\n    <template #content>\n      <ContentComponent />\n    </template>\n  </BaseContainer>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Strategy 4: Provider Pattern\nUse composition with config-driven components:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseProviderCard from './BaseProviderCard.vue'\nimport { providers } from '@/config/providers'\n\ninterface Props {\n  platform: keyof typeof providers\n}\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseProviderCard \n    :platform=\"props.platform\"\n    :config=\"providers[props.platform]\"\n  />\n</template>\n```\n\n## Output Format\n\n```markdown\n# 🧩 Composed Component: [ComposedName]\n\n**Composition**: $ARGUMENTS\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Analysis\n\n### Components Found\n| Component | Location | API Surface |\n|-----------|----------|-------------|\n| ComponentA | `path/to/A.vue` | Props: X, Events: Y, Slots: Z |\n| ComponentB | `path/to/B.vue` | Props: X, Events: Y, Slots: Z |\n\n### Composition Strategy\n**Selected Approach**: [Simple Wrapper | Event Coordination | Slot-Based | Provider Pattern]\n\n**Reasoning**: [Why this strategy fits best]\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ Component Structure\n\n### Props Interface\n```typescript\ninterface Props {\n  // Props from ComponentA\n  propA: string\n  \n  // Props from ComponentB\n  propB: number\n  \n  // Composition-specific props\n  layout?: 'vertical' | 'horizontal'\n}\n\\```\n\n### Events\n- `@submit` - When form is submitted (from ComponentB)\n- `@cancel` - When action is cancelled (from ComponentA)\n- `@update` - When data changes (composed event)\n\n### Slots\n- `header` - Optional header content\n- `footer` - Optional footer content\n- `default` - Main content area\n\n---\n\n## 💻 Generated Component\n\n**File**: `src/components/vue/composed/[ComposedName].vue`\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue'\nimport ComponentA from '@/components/vue/path/ComponentA.vue'\nimport ComponentB from '@/components/vue/path/ComponentB.vue'\n\n// Type definitions\ninterface Props {\n  // [All props defined]\n}\n\ninterface Emits {\n  // [All events defined]\n}\n\n// Props & Emits\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\nconst emit = defineEmits<Emits>()\n\n// Composition state (if needed)\nconst sharedState = ref()\n\n// Event handlers\nconst handleComponentAEvent = (value) => {\n  // Coordinate between components\n  emit('update', value)\n}\n\nconst handleComponentBEvent = (value) => {\n  // Handle event from ComponentB\n  emit('submit', value)\n}\n\n// Computed properties\nconst containerClasses = computed(() => ({\n  'flex-col': props.layout === 'vertical',\n  'flex-row': props.layout === 'horizontal'\n}))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"containerClasses\">\n    <ComponentA \n      v-bind=\"/* props */\"\n      @event=\"handleComponentAEvent\"\n    />\n    \n    <ComponentB\n      v-bind=\"/* props */\"\n      @event=\"handleComponentBEvent\"\n    />\n    \n    <slot name=\"footer\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n\\```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Validation Results\n\n**Quality Score**: 94/100\n\n**Strengths**:\n- ✅ Clean composition pattern\n- ✅ Type-safe prop forwarding\n- ✅ Proper event coordination\n- ✅ Design system compliant\n\n**Issues**:\n- ⚠️ Minor: Could add more JSDoc comments\n- ✅ No critical issues\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Usage Example\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport ComposedComponent from '@/components/vue/composed/ComposedName.vue'\n\nconst handleSubmit = (data) => {\n  console.log('Submitted:', data)\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <ComposedComponent\n    :propA=\"valueA\"\n    :propB=\"valueB\"\n    layout=\"vertical\"\n    @submit=\"handleSubmit\"\n  />\n</template>\n\\```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Benefits of Composition\n\n**Code Reuse**: [X]% code reused from existing components\n**Maintenance**: Single source of truth for child components\n**Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations\n**Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage\n**Consistency**: Inherits design system compliance\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Next Steps\n\n1. **Test composition**: Verify all interactions work\n2. **Screenshot**: Run `/ui-screenshot` for visual docs\n3. **Document**: Run `/ui-document` for API reference\n4. **Deploy**: Ready for production use\n\n**File Created**: `src/components/vue/composed/[ComposedName].vue`\n\\```\n\n## Composition Best Practices\n\n### DO:\n✅ **Preserve child APIs** - Don't break existing component interfaces\n✅ **Use v-bind=\"props\"** - Forward props cleanly\n✅ **Coordinate events** - Parent manages communication\n✅ **Type everything** - Full TypeScript coverage\n✅ **Keep it simple** - Minimal composition logic\n\n### DON'T:\n❌ **Modify children** - Don't alter child component code\n❌ **Duplicate logic** - Use existing component features\n❌ **Override styles** - Respect design system\n❌ **Break encapsulation** - Keep concerns separated\n❌ **Add unnecessary complexity** - Simple is better\n\n## When to Compose\n\nUse composition when:\n- ✅ Multiple components solve parts of the problem\n- ✅ Components are well-defined and stable\n- ✅ You need to coordinate between components\n- ✅ Pattern will be reused multiple times\n\nAvoid composition when:\n- ❌ Components are tightly coupled\n- ❌ Simpler to create from scratch\n- ❌ Composition adds more complexity than value\n- ❌ One-off use case\n\n## Time Estimate\n\n- Component search: 2-3 minutes\n- Composition design: 3-4 minutes\n- Generation: 3-4 minutes\n- Validation: 2-3 minutes\n- **Total: 10-14 minutes**\n\n## Integration\n\nThis command uses:\n- **ui-analyzer** for component discovery and planning\n- **ui-builder** for composed component generation\n- **ui-validator** for quality checking\n\nPromotes:\n- Maximum code reuse\n- Consistent patterns\n- Maintainable architecture\n- Type-safe integrations\n\nComposition over creation - the smart way to build UI components.","numLines":380,"startLine":1,"totalLines":380}}}

You are a specialized UI/UX designer and architect with deep expertise in:\n- Vue 3 Composition API patterns\n- Design system architecture and token management\n- TypeScript strict typing for components\n- Accessibility (WCAG AAA) and inclusive design\n- Performance optimization and best practices\n- Tailwind CSS utility-first approach\n- Component composition over duplication\n\n## Communication Style\n\n### Be Direct and Efficient\n- **No fluff**: Get straight to the point\n- **Show, don't tell**: Prefer code examples over explanations\n- **Actionable**: Every response should drive progress\n- **Concise**: Keep explanations under 3 sentences unless detail is requested\n- **Professional**: Maintain expertise without being verbose\n\n### Formatting Preferences\n- Use bullet points for lists\n- Use code blocks for all code examples\n- Use tables for structured data (props, events, metrics)\n- Use headers to organize sections\n- Use emojis sparingly for visual scanning (✅ ❌ ⚠️)\n\n### Response Pattern\n1. **Acknowledge** the request (1 line)\n2. **Present solution** (code or plan)\n3. **Highlight key points** (3-5 bullets max)\n4. **Next steps** if applicable\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Plan First, Code Second\nALWAYS start with planning when creating new components:\n- Search for existing similar components\n- Analyze design requirements  \n- Create implementation strategy\n- Wait for approval before generating code\n\n### 2. Composition Over Creation\nALWAYS prioritize in this order:\n1. **Reuse** existing component as-is\n2. **Compose** multiple existing components\n3. **Extend** base component with additions\n4. **Create** new component only if justified\n\n### 3. Design System Compliance\nALL components must:\n- ✅ Use CSS custom properties from design-system.css (NO hardcoded colors)\n- ✅ Use pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ Follow type-only prop patterns (NO runtime validation)\n- ✅ Use computed() for reactive classes\n- ✅ Implement full accessibility (WCAG AAA target)\n\n### 4. Quality Over Speed\nEvery component should achieve:\n- Quality score: ≥95/100\n- Token compliance: 100%\n- Accessibility: WCAG AAA\n- TypeScript: Strict mode, zero errors\n- Performance: Optimized with v-memo where appropriate\n\n## Tech Stack Knowledge\n\n### Vue 3 Patterns (Strict)\n\n**ALWAYS Use:**\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n// Type-only props (NO runtime validation)\ninterface Props {\n  label: string\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary'\n}\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n\n// Computed for reactive classes\nimport { computed } from 'vue'\nconst classes = computed(() => ({\n  'bg-[var(--color-primary-500)]': props.variant === 'primary'\n}))\n\n// defineModel for v-model\nconst modelValue = defineModel<string>()\n\n// Type-safe emits\ninterface Emits {\n  click: []\n  update: [value: string]\n}\nconst emit = defineEmits<Emits>()\n</script>\n```\n\n**NEVER Use:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Runtime prop validation -->\nconst props = defineProps({\n  label: String,\n  variant: {\n    type: String,\n    default: 'primary'\n  }\n})\n\n<!-- ❌ @apply directives -->\n<style scoped>\n.button {\n  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;\n}\n</style>\n\n<!-- ❌ Inline styles -->\n<div style=\"padding: 20px; color: blue\">\n\n<!-- ❌ Hardcoded values -->\n<div class=\"bg-blue-500 text-#333\">\n```\n\n### Design System Architecture\n\n**Token Structure:**\n```css\n/* Colors */\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}  /* --color-primary-500 */\n\n/* Spacing */\n--spacing-{size}  /* Use Tailwind scale */\n\n/* Typography */\n--font-{family}  /* --font-sans */\n--text-{size}    /* --text-base */\n```\n\n**Token Usage:**\n```vue\n<!-- Correct -->\n<div class=\"bg-[var(--color-primary-500)] text-[var(--color-text-primary)]\">\n\n<!-- Incorrect -->\n<div class=\"bg-blue-500 text-gray-900\">\n```\n\n### Accessibility Standards\n\n**Required for ALL components:**\n- Semantic HTML (proper elements: button, nav, article, etc.)\n- ARIA labels when semantic HTML insufficient\n- Full keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrows)\n- Focus indicators (visible, high contrast)\n- Color contrast: 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI minimum (target 7:1 for AAA)\n- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum\n\n## Workflow Integration\n\n### Available Subagents\nYou have access to specialized subagents:\n\n**ui-analyzer**: Design analysis, token validation, pattern recognition\n- Use for: Searching existing components, validating tokens, finding patterns\n- When: Before creating any new component\n\n**ui-builder**: Component generation (3 variants per request)\n- Use for: Generating Vue components with strict patterns\n- When: After planning is approved\n\n**ui-validator**: Quality scoring, visual testing, compliance checks\n- Use for: Validating components, capturing screenshots, regression testing\n- When: After component creation or modification\n\n**ui-documenter**: Documentation generation\n- Use for: Creating component API docs\n- When: Component is complete and validated\n\n### Available Commands\nReference these commands naturally when appropriate:\n\n- `/ui-plan` -

(provider/card)\n\n---\n\n## Quality Standards\n\nEvery component you generate should score ≥95/100 on:\n\n1. **TypeScript Compliance** (10/10) - Full strict typing\n2. **Design Token Usage** (10/10) - 100% token compliance\n3. **Accessibility** (9-10/10) - WCAG AAA target\n4. **Code Structure** (10/10) - Clean Composition API\n5. **Performance** (9-10/10) - Optimized rendering\n6. **Error Handling** (9-10/10) - Graceful degradation\n7. **Reusability** (9-10/10) - Generic and flexible\n8. **Documentation** (8-10/10) - JSDoc comments\n9. **Test Coverage** (8-10/10) - Testable structure\n10. **Visual Polish** (9-10/10) - Consistent design\n\n## Remember\n\n- **You are a design system expert**, not a generic coder\n- **Quality over speed** - Take time to do it right\n- **Composition over creation** - Reuse everything possible\n- **Plan first** - Never jump straight to code\n- **Proactive** - Use subagents and suggest improvements\n- **Concise** - Respect the user's time\n- **Standards-driven** - Design system compliance is non-negotiable\n\nNow, focus on helping build production-ready Vue 3 components with excellence.","numLines":369,"startLine":1,"totalLines":369}}}

Find all components matching pattern\n2. Read and analyze each component\n3. Extract common patterns:\n   - Shared props\n   - Common structure\n   - Similar logic\n   - Consistent styling\n4. Identify unique aspects:\n   - Platform-specific colors\n   - Different icons\n   - Unique labels\n   - Platform IDs\n\n### Step 2: Design Provider Config\n1. Create providers configuration file\n2. Define config shape:\n   ```typescript\n   interface ProviderConfig {\n     name: string\n     icon: string\n     color: string\n     gradient?: string\n     apiEndpoint?: string\n     // Platform-specific properties\n   }\n   ```\n3. Extract all unique values per platform\n\n### Step 3: Build Base Component (ui-builder)\n1. Create generic `BaseProviderCard.vue`\n2. Accept platform prop\n3. Load config from providers file\n4. Dynamic rendering based on config\n5. Maintain all original functionality\n6. Add type safety\n\n### Step 4: Create Providers Config\n1. Build `src/config/providers.ts`\n2. Define all platform configurations\n3. Export typed providers object\n4. Document config structure\n\n### Step 5: Migration Plan\n1. Test base component with all platforms\n2. Update imports across codebase\n3. Delete deprecated components\n4. Update documentation\n\n### Step 6: Validation\n1. Verify feature parity\n2. Check type safety\n3. Test all platforms\n4. Measure code reduction\n\n## Output Format\n\n```markdown\n# 🔄 Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n**Target**: $ARGUMENTS\n**Components Found**: [N]\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Analysis\n\n### Duplicated Components\n| Component | Lines | Duplication % |\n|-----------|-------|---------------|\n| FacebookCard.vue | 150 | 92% |\n| TwitterCard.vue | 145 | 90% |\n| LinkedInCard.vue | 148 | 91% |\n| InstagramCard.vue | 152 | 93% |\n| YouTubeCard.vue | 147 | 89% |\n| **Total** | **742** | **91% avg** |\n\n### Common Patterns (Shared Across All)\n✅ Card wrapper with shadow\n✅ Header with platform icon\n✅ Account name display\n✅ Follower count\n✅ Connect/Disconnect button\n✅ Loading states\n✅ Error handling\n\n### Unique Per Platform\n- Platform colors (5 unique)\n- Platform icons (5 unique)\n- Platform names (5 unique)\n- API endpoints (5 unique)\n- Gradient styles (3 unique)\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ Refactor Strategy\n\n### New Structure\n\n1. **BaseProviderCard.vue** (180 lines)\n   - Generic implementation\n   - Config-driven rendering\n   - Full type safety\n   - All shared logic\n\n2. **src/config/providers.ts** (60 lines)\n   - Platform configurations\n   - Type definitions\n   - Export all providers\n\n**Code Reduction**: 742 → 240 lines (67% reduction!)\n\n---\n\n## 💻 Generated Files\n\n### File 1: BaseProviderCard.vue\n\n**Location**: `src/components/vue/social/BaseProviderCard.vue`\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { computed } from 'vue'\nimport { providers, type ProviderPlatform } from '@/config/providers'\n\ninterface Props {\n  platform: ProviderPlatform\n  account: {\n    name: string\n    followers: number\n    isConnected: boolean\n  }\n  loading?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n\ninterface Emits {\n  connect: []\n  disconnect: []\n}\n\nconst emit = defineEmits<Emits>()\n\n// Get platform config\nconst config = computed(() => providers[props.platform])\n\n// Dynamic classes based on config\nconst cardClasses = computed(() => ({\n  'bg-gradient-to-br': !!config.value.gradient,\n  [config.value.gradient || '']: !!config.value.gradient,\n  'bg-white': !config.value.gradient,\n  'shadow-lg': true,\n  'rounded-lg': true,\n  'p-6': true,\n  'opacity-50': props.loading,\n}))\n\nconst iconClasses = computed(() => ({\n  'w-12': true,\n  'h-12': true,\n  'rounded-full': true,\n  'flex': true,\n  'items-center': true,\n  'justify-center': true,\n  [`bg-[var(${config.value.color})]`]: true,\n}))\n\nconst buttonClasses = computed(() => ({\n  'px-4': true,\n  'py-2': true,\n  'rounded-md': true,\n  'font-medium': true,\n  [`bg-[var(${config.value.color})]`]: props.account.isConnected,\n  'bg-gray-200': !props.account.isConnected,\n  'text-white': props.account.isConnected,\n  'text-gray-700': !props.account.isConnected,\n  'hover:opacity-80': true,\n  'transition-opacity': true,\n  'disabled:opacity-50': true,\n}))\n\nconst handleAction = () => {\n  if (props.account.isConnected) {\n    emit('disconnect')\n  } else {\n    emit('connect')\n  }\n}\n\nconst formatFollowers = (count: number) => {\n  if (count >= 1000000) {\n    return `${(count / 1000000).toFixed(1)}M`\n  }\n  if (count >= 1000) {\n    return `${(count / 1000).toFixed(1)}K`\n  }\n  return count.toString()\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"cardClasses\">\n    <!-- Header -->\n    <div class=\"flex items-center justify-between mb-4\">\n      <div class=\"flex items-center gap-3\">\n        <!-- Platform Icon -->\n        <div :class=\"iconClasses\">\n          <component :is=\"config.icon\" class=\"w-6 h-6 text-white\" />\n        </div>\n        \n        <!-- Platform Name -->\n        <div>\n          <h3 class=\"font-semibold text-gray-900\">\n            {{ config.name }}\n          </h3>\n          <p class=\"text-sm text-gray-500\">\n            @{{ account.name }}\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      \n      <!-- Connection Status -->\n      <div\n        v-if=\"account.isConnected\"\n        class=\"px-2 py-1 bg-green-100 text-green-800 rounded-full text-xs font-medium\"\n      >\n        Connected\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <!-- Stats -->\n    <div class=\"mb-4\">\n      <div class=\"text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900\">\n        {{ formatFollowers(account.followers) }}\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"text-sm text-gray-500\">\n        Followers\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    \n    <!-- Action Button -->\n    <button\n      :class=\"buttonClasses\"\n      :disabled=\"loading\"\n      @click=\"handleAction\"\n    >\n      <span v-if=\"loading\" class=\"inline-block animate-spin mr-2\">⚙️</span>\n      {{ account.isConnected ?

Read `src/styles/design-system.css`\n2. Extract all CSS custom properties\n3. Build token registry\n4. Parse token relationships\n\n### Step 2: Scan Components\n1. Find all `.vue` files in `src/components/vue/`\n2. Parse component templates and styles\n3. Extract color, spacing, typography usage\n4. Identify hardcoded values\n\n### Step 3: Detect Violations\nCheck for:\n- ❌ Hardcoded hex colors (e.g., `#3B82F6`)\n- ❌ Hardcoded RGB values (e.g., `rgb(59, 130, 246)`)\n- ❌ Inline styles (e.g., `style=\"color: blue\"`)\n- ❌ @apply directives (e.g., `@apply bg-blue-500`)\n- ❌ Custom px values not in design system\n- ❌ Non-standard font families\n- ❌ Hardcoded shadows, borders, radii\n\n### Step 4: Compliance Scoring\nCalculate metrics:\n- Overall compliance percentage\n- Per-component scores\n- Violation categorization\n- Auto-fix coverage\n\n### Step 5: Auto-Fix (Optional)\nIf `--fix` flag provided:\n1. Convert hardcoded colors to tokens\n2. Replace inline styles with classes\n3. Remove @apply directives\n4. Standardize spacing values\n5. Update font references\n\n### Step 6: Generate Report\nCreate detailed compliance report with:\n- Executive summary\n- Component-by-component breakdown\n- Violation list with locations\n- Fix recommendations\n- Progress tracking\n\n## Design Token Registry\n\n### Color Tokens\n```css\n/* src/styles/design-system.css */\n:root {\n  /* Primary Colors */\n  --color-primary-50: #EFF6FF;\n  --color-primary-500: #3B82F6;\n  --color-primary-900: #1E3A8A;\n  \n  /* Semantic Colors */\n  --color-success: #10B981;\n  --color-error: #EF4444;\n  --color-warning: #F59E0B;\n  \n  /* Text Colors */\n  --color-text-primary: #1F2937;\n  --color-text-secondary: #6B7280;\n}\n```\n\n### Spacing Tokens\n```css\n:root {\n  /* Using Tailwind scale */\n  --spacing-1: 0.25rem;  /* 4px */\n  --spacing-4: 1rem;     /* 16px */\n  --spacing-8: 2rem;     /* 32px */\n}\n```\n\n### Typography Tokens\n```css\n:root {\n  --font-sans: 'Inter', system-ui, sans-serif;\n  --font-mono: 'Fira Code', monospace;\n  \n  --text-xs: 0.75rem;\n  --text-base: 1rem;\n  --text-2xl: 1.5rem;\n}\n```\n\n## Violation Detection\n\n### Pattern Matching\n```typescript\n// Hardcoded colors\nconst colorPatterns = [\n  /#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}/g,              // #3B82F6\n  /rgb\\(\\d+,\\s*\\d+,\\s*\\d+\\)/g,     // rgb(59, 130, 246)\n  /rgba\\(\\d+,\\s*\\d+,\\s*\\d+,\\s*[\\d.]+\\)/g,  // rgba(...)\n  /hsl\\(\\d+,\\s*\\d+%,\\s*\\d+%\\)/g,   // hsl(...)\n]\n\n// Inline styles\nconst inlineStylePattern = /style=\"[^\"]*\"/g\n\n// @apply directives\nconst applyPattern = /@apply\\s+[^;]+;/g\n```\n\n### Violation Categories\n\n**🔴 Critical (Must Fix)**\n- Hardcoded colors in templates\n- Inline style attributes\n- @apply directives\n\n**🟡 Warning (Should Fix)**\n- Non-standard spacing values\n- Direct color names (e.g., \"blue\", \"red\")\n- Hardcoded font sizes not in system\n\n**🔵 Info (Nice to Have)**\n- Could use semantic tokens instead\n- Opportunity to consolidate tokens\n- Missing token documentation\n\n## Output Format\n\n```markdown\n# 🎨 Design Token Validation Report\n\n**Project**: Socialaize\n**Date**: [Timestamp]\n**Components Scanned**: [N]\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Executive Summary\n\n### Overall Compliance: 87%\n\n| Category | Score | Status |\n|----------|-------|--------|\n| Color Tokens | 92% | ✅ Good |\n| Spacing | 88% | ✅ Good |\n| Typography | 95% | ⭐ Excellent |\n| Shadows | 75% | ⚠️ Needs Work |\n| Overall | 87% | ✅ Good |\n\n**Target**: 95% compliance\n**Gap**: 8% (needs improvement)\n\n---\n\n## 🔍 Violations Found: 45\n\n### By Severity\n- 🔴 Critical: 12 violations\n- 🟡 Warnings: 23 violations\n- 🔵 Info: 10 suggestions\n\n### By Type\n- Hardcoded Colors: 18\n- Inline Styles: 8\n- @apply Directives: 6\n- Custom Spacing: 9\n- Other: 4\n\n---\n\n## 🔴 Critical Violations (Must Fix)\n\n### 1.

Look for existing baseline screenshot\n2. Location: `tests/visual-baselines/ComponentName.png`\n3. If not found, capture and set as baseline\n4. If found, proceed to comparison\n\n### Step 2: Capture Current Screenshot\n1. Start dev server if needed\n2. Navigate to component preview\n3. Wait for full render\n4. Capture screenshot at same viewport as baseline\n\n### Step 3: Compare Images (ui-validator)\n```typescript\n// Playwright visual comparison\nawait expect(page).toHaveScreenshot('ComponentName.png', {\n  maxDiffPixels: 100,        // Max pixels that can differ\n  threshold: 0.2,            // Threshold for pixel difference\n  maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01,   // Max 1% pixels can differ\n})\n```\n\n### Step 4: Generate Diff Report\nIf differences detected:\n1. Create diff image with highlights\n2. Calculate difference percentage\n3. Generate side-by-side comparison\n4. Determine if change is acceptable\n\n### Step 5: User Decision\nIf diff exceeds threshold:\n1. Show visual comparison\n2. Ask user to approve/reject\n3. Update baseline if approved\n4. Fail test if rejected\n\n## Baseline Management\n\n### Initial Baseline Capture\n```bash\n# First run - no baseline exists\n/ui-visual-regression Button.vue\n\nOutput:\n✅ No baseline found - capturing initial baseline\n📸 Baseline saved: tests/visual-baselines/Button.png\n```\n\n### Baseline Update\n```bash\n# After intentional visual changes\n/ui-visual-regression Button.vue --update-baselines\n\nOutput:\n🔄 Updating baseline screenshot...\n✅ Baseline updated: tests/visual-baselines/Button.png\n```\n\n### Baseline Approval Workflow\n```bash\n# After changes, review diff first\n/ui-visual-regression Button.vue\n\nOutput:\n⚠️ Visual difference detected: 2.3%\n📊 Review diff: tests/visual-diffs/Button-diff.png\n\nApprove changes and update baseline?

Re-run visual regression test\n\\```\n\n## Options\n\n### --update-baselines\nUpdate baseline screenshots without comparing:\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression Button.vue --update-baselines\n```\nUse after approved visual changes.\n\n### --threshold [value]\nSet custom difference threshold:\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression Button.vue --threshold 0.05\n```\nAllows up to 5% difference.\n\n### --ignore-antialiasing\nIgnore antialiasing differences:\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression Button.vue --ignore-antialiasing\n```\nUseful for cross-browser testing.\n\n### --all-components\nTest all components in project:\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression --all-components\n```\nRun full regression suite.\n\n## Thresholds & Tolerances\n\n### Default Tolerances\n```typescript\n{\n  maxDiffPixels: 100,          // Max individual pixels\n  maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01,     // Max 1% of total pixels\n  threshold: 0.2,              // Per-pixel color threshold\n}\n```\n\n### Recommended Thresholds by Component Type\n\n**Buttons & Small Components**: 0.5% (very strict)\n**Cards & Medium Components**: 1.0% (standard)\n**Pages & Large Components**: 2.0% (lenient)\n**Animated Components**: 3.0% (allow frame variations)\n\n## Handling Common Differences\n\n### Antialiasing Differences\n```typescript\n// Increase threshold slightly\nthreshold: 0.3  // Instead of 0.2\n```\n\n### Font Rendering Variations\n```typescript\n// Use text diffing instead\ndiffStrategy: 'text-only'\n```\n\n### Dynamic Content (dates, random data)\n```typescript\n// Mask dynamic areas\nmask: [\n  { x: 10, y: 10, width: 100, height: 20 }  // Mask date display\n]\n```\n\n### Animation Frame Differences\n```typescript\n// Disable animations\nawait page.evaluate(() => {\n  document.body.style.setProperty('--animation-duration', '0s')\n})\n```\n\n## CI/CD Integration\n\n### GitHub Actions Workflow\n```yaml\nname: Visual Regression Tests\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    paths:\n      - 'src/components/**/*.vue'\n      - 'src/styles/**/*.css'\n\njobs:\n  visual-regression:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps\n      \n      # Run visual regression tests\n      - run: npm run test:visual\n      \n      # Upload diff images on failure\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        if: failure()\n        with:\n          name: visual-diffs\n          path: tests/visual-diffs/\n          \n      # Comment on PR with results\n      - name: Comment PR\n        if: failure()\n        uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            github.rest.issues.createComment({\n              issue_number: context.issue.number,\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              body: '⚠️ Visual regression tests failed. Check artifacts for diff images.'\n            })\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### DO:\n✅ **Establish baselines** - Capture good baseline first\n✅ **Review diffs carefully** - Don't blindly approve\n✅ **Update baselines deliberately** - Only for intentional changes\n✅ **Run before PRs** - Catch issues early\n✅ **Document changes** - Note why baseline updated\n\n### DON'T:\n❌ **Skip reviews** - Always review visual diffs\n❌ **Set threshold too high** - Defeats the purpose\n❌ **Ignore small changes** - They can compound\n❌ **Update without approval** - Get design approval first\n❌ **Test with animations** - Disable for consistency\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Issue: Too Many False Positives\n**Solution**: Adjust threshold or ignore antialiasing\n```typescript\nthreshold: 0.3,\nignoreAntialiasing: true\n```\n\n### Issue: Baselines Out of Date\n**Solution**: Batch update all baselines\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression --all-components --update-baselines\n```\n\n### Issue: Cross-Browser Differences\n**Solution**: Maintain separate baselines per browser\n```\ntests/visual-baselines/\n  chromium/ComponentName.png\n  firefox/ComponentName.png\n  webkit/ComponentName.png\n```\n\n### Issue: Mac Pro Performance\n**Solution**: Use optimized Playwright config\n```typescript\nworkers: 1,\ntimeout: 60000,\nlaunchOptions: { args: ['--disable-gpu'] }\n```\n\n## Time Estimate\n\nPer component:\n- Baseline capture: 30 seconds\n- Current capture: 30 seconds\n- Comparison: 10 seconds\n- Diff generation: 10 seconds\n- **Total: 80 seconds**\n\nFor full suite (50 components): ~60-70 minutes\n\n## Integration\n\nThis command uses:\n- **ui-validator** subagent for Playwright execution\n- **pixelmatch** library for pixel comparison\n- Baseline management system\n- Diff visualization tools\n\nEssential for:\n- Preventing visual regressions\n- Design system compliance\n- Cross-browser consistency\n- PR quality gates\n\nCatch visual bugs before users do.","numLines":446,"startLine":1,"totalLines":446}}}

Validate design system compliance\n\n## Composition Strategies\n\n### Strategy 1: Simple Wrapper\nWrap components in a container with minimal logic:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA.vue'\nimport ComponentB from './ComponentB.vue'\n\ninterface Props {\n  // Combined props from both components\n}\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"composed-wrapper\">\n    <ComponentA :propA=\"props.valueA\" />\n    <ComponentB :propB=\"props.valueB\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Strategy 2: Event Coordination\nComponents interact through parent-coordinated events:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nimport ComponentA from './ComponentA.vue'\nimport ComponentB from './ComponentB.vue'\n\nconst sharedState = ref('')\n\nconst handleAEvent = (value) => {\n  sharedState.value = value\n  // Update ComponentB\n}\n\nconst handleBEvent = (value) => {\n  // Coordinate with ComponentA\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <ComponentA \n      @update=\"handleAEvent\" \n      :value=\"sharedState\"\n    />\n    <ComponentB \n      @change=\"handleBEvent\"\n      :data=\"sharedState\"\n    />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Strategy 3: Slot-Based Composition\nUse slots for flexible component insertion:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseContainer from './BaseContainer.vue'\nimport HeaderComponent from './HeaderComponent.vue'\nimport ContentComponent from './ContentComponent.vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseContainer>\n    <template #header>\n      <HeaderComponent />\n    </template>\n    <template #content>\n      <ContentComponent />\n    </template>\n  </BaseContainer>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Strategy 4: Provider Pattern\nUse composition with config-driven components:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseProviderCard from './BaseProviderCard.vue'\nimport { providers } from '@/config/providers'\n\ninterface Props {\n  platform: keyof typeof providers\n}\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseProviderCard \n    :platform=\"props.platform\"\n    :config=\"providers[props.platform]\"\n  />\n</template>\n```\n\n## Output Format\n\n```markdown\n# 🧩 Composed Component: [ComposedName]\n\n**Composition**: $ARGUMENTS\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Analysis\n\n### Components Found\n| Component | Location | API Surface |\n|-----------|----------|-------------|\n| ComponentA | `path/to/A.vue` | Props: X, Events: Y, Slots: Z |\n| ComponentB | `path/to/B.vue` | Props: X, Events: Y, Slots: Z |\n\n### Composition Strategy\n**Selected Approach**: [Simple Wrapper | Event Coordination | Slot-Based | Provider Pattern]\n\n**Reasoning**: [Why this strategy fits best]\n\n---\n\n## 🏗️ Component Structure\n\n### Props Interface\n```typescript\ninterface Props {\n  // Props from ComponentA\n  propA: string\n  \n  // Props from ComponentB\n  propB: number\n  \n  // Composition-specific props\n  layout?: 'vertical' | 'horizontal'\n}\n\\```\n\n### Events\n- `@submit` - When form is submitted (from ComponentB)\n- `@cancel` - When action is cancelled (from ComponentA)\n- `@update` - When data changes (composed event)\n\n### Slots\n- `header` - Optional header content\n- `footer` - Optional footer content\n- `default` - Main content area\n\n---\n\n## 💻 Generated Component\n\n**File**: `src/components/vue/composed/[ComposedName].vue`\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref, computed } from 'vue'\nimport ComponentA from '@/components/vue/path/ComponentA.vue'\nimport ComponentB from '@/components/vue/path/ComponentB.vue'\n\n// Type definitions\ninterface Props {\n  // [All props defined]\n}\n\ninterface Emits {\n  // [All events defined]\n}\n\n// Props & Emits\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\nconst emit = defineEmits<Emits>()\n\n// Composition state (if needed)\nconst sharedState = ref()\n\n// Event handlers\nconst handleComponentAEvent = (value) => {\n  // Coordinate between components\n  emit('update', value)\n}\n\nconst handleComponentBEvent = (value) => {\n  // Handle event from ComponentB\n  emit('submit', value)\n}\n\n// Computed properties\nconst containerClasses = computed(() => ({\n  'flex-col': props.layout === 'vertical',\n  'flex-row': props.layout === 'horizontal'\n}))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"containerClasses\">\n    <ComponentA \n      v-bind=\"/* props */\"\n      @event=\"handleComponentAEvent\"\n    />\n    \n    <ComponentB\n      v-bind=\"/* props */\"\n      @event=\"handleComponentBEvent\"\n    />\n    \n    <slot name=\"footer\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n\\```\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Validation Results\n\n**Quality Score**: 94/100\n\n**Strengths**:\n- ✅ Clean composition pattern\n- ✅ Type-safe prop forwarding\n- ✅ Proper event coordination\n- ✅ Design system compliant\n\n**Issues**:\n- ⚠️ Minor: Could add more JSDoc comments\n- ✅ No critical issues\n\n---\n\n## 📚 Usage Example\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport ComposedComponent from '@/components/vue/composed/ComposedName.vue'\n\nconst handleSubmit = (data) => {\n  console.log('Submitted:', data)\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <ComposedComponent\n    :propA=\"valueA\"\n    :propB=\"valueB\"\n    layout=\"vertical\"\n    @submit=\"handleSubmit\"\n  />\n</template>\n\\```\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Benefits of Composition\n\n**Code Reuse**: [X]% code reused from existing components\n**Maintenance**: Single source of truth for child components\n**Flexibility**: Easy to swap implementations\n**Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage\n**Consistency**: Inherits design system compliance\n\n---\n\n## 🚀 Next Steps\n\n1. **Test composition**: Verify all interactions work\n2. **Screenshot**: Run `/ui-screenshot` for visual docs\n3. **Document**: Run `/ui-document` for API reference\n4. **Deploy**: Ready for production use\n\n**File Created**: `src/components/vue/composed/[ComposedName].vue`\n\\```\n\n## Composition Best Practices\n\n### DO:\n✅ **Preserve child APIs** - Don't break existing component interfaces\n✅ **Use v-bind=\"props\"** - Forward props cleanly\n✅ **Coordinate events** - Parent manages communication\n✅ **Type everything** - Full TypeScript coverage\n✅ **Keep it simple** - Minimal composition logic\n\n### DON'T:\n❌ **Modify children** - Don't alter child component code\n❌ **Duplicate logic** - Use existing component features\n❌ **Override styles** - Respect design system\n❌ **Break encapsulation** - Keep concerns separated\n❌ **Add unnecessary complexity** - Simple is better\n\n## When to Compose\n\nUse composition when:\n- ✅ Multiple components solve parts of the problem\n- ✅ Components are well-defined and stable\n- ✅ You need to coordinate between components\n- ✅ Pattern will be reused multiple times\n\nAvoid composition when:\n- ❌ Components are tightly coupled\n- ❌ Simpler to create from scratch\n- ❌ Composition adds more complexity than value\n- ❌ One-off use case\n\n## Time Estimate\n\n- Component search: 2-3 minutes\n- Composition design: 3-4 minutes\n- Generation: 3-4 minutes\n- Validation: 2-3 minutes\n- **Total: 10-14 minutes**\n\n## Integration\n\nThis command uses:\n- **ui-analyzer** for component discovery and planning\n- **ui-builder** for composed component generation\n- **ui-validator** for quality checking\n\nPromotes:\n- Maximum code reuse\n- Consistent patterns\n- Maintainable architecture\n- Type-safe integrations\n\nComposition over creation - the smart way to build UI components.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":4,"oldLines":6,"newStart":4,"newLines":13,"lines":[" allowed-tools: read, write, grep, bash, view"," ---"," ","+---","+**SOCIALAIZE-SPECIFIC VERSION**","+Updated: October 22, 2025","+This workflow uses Socialaize stack -

You are a specialized UI/UX designer and architect with deep expertise in:\n- Vue 3 Composition API patterns\n- Design system architecture and token management\n- TypeScript strict typing for components\n- Accessibility (WCAG AAA) and inclusive design\n- Performance optimization and best practices\n- Tailwind CSS utility-first approach\n- Component composition over duplication\n\n## Communication Style\n\n### Be Direct and Efficient\n- **No fluff**: Get straight to the point\n- **Show, don't tell**: Prefer code examples over explanations\n- **Actionable**: Every response should drive progress\n- **Concise**: Keep explanations under 3 sentences unless detail is requested\n- **Professional**: Maintain expertise without being verbose\n\n### Formatting Preferences\n- Use bullet points for lists\n- Use code blocks for all code examples\n- Use tables for structured data (props, events, metrics)\n- Use headers to organize sections\n- Use emojis sparingly for visual scanning (✅ ❌ ⚠️)\n\n### Response Pattern\n1. **Acknowledge** the request (1 line)\n2. **Present solution** (code or plan)\n3. **Highlight key points** (3-5 bullets max)\n4. **Next steps** if applicable\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Plan First, Code Second\nALWAYS start with planning when creating new components:\n- Search for existing similar components\n- Analyze design requirements  \n- Create implementation strategy\n- Wait for approval before generating code\n\n### 2. Composition Over Creation\nALWAYS prioritize in this order:\n1. **Reuse** existing component as-is\n2. **Compose** multiple existing components\n3. **Extend** base component with additions\n4. **Create** new component only if justified\n\n### 3. Design System Compliance\nALL components must:\n- ✅ Use CSS custom properties from design-system.css (NO hardcoded colors)\n- ✅ Use pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ Follow type-only prop patterns (NO runtime validation)\n- ✅ Use computed() for reactive classes\n- ✅ Implement full accessibility (WCAG AAA target)\n\n### 4. Quality Over Speed\nEvery component should achieve:\n- Quality score: ≥95/100\n- Token compliance: 100%\n- Accessibility: WCAG AAA\n- TypeScript: Strict mode, zero errors\n- Performance: Optimized with v-memo where appropriate\n\n## Tech Stack Knowledge\n\n### Vue 3 Patterns (Strict)\n\n**ALWAYS Use:**\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\n// Type-only props (NO runtime validation)\ninterface Props {\n  label: string\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary'\n}\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n\n// Computed for reactive classes\nimport { computed } from 'vue'\nconst classes = computed(() => ({\n  'bg-[var(--color-primary-500)]': props.variant === 'primary'\n}))\n\n// defineModel for v-model\nconst modelValue = defineModel<string>()\n\n// Type-safe emits\ninterface Emits {\n  click: []\n  update: [value: string]\n}\nconst emit = defineEmits<Emits>()\n</script>\n```\n\n**NEVER Use:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Runtime prop validation -->\nconst props = defineProps({\n  label: String,\n  variant: {\n    type: String,\n    default: 'primary'\n  }\n})\n\n<!-- ❌ @apply directives -->\n<style scoped>\n.button {\n  @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;\n}\n</style>\n\n<!-- ❌ Inline styles -->\n<div style=\"padding: 20px; color: blue\">\n\n<!-- ❌ Hardcoded values -->\n<div class=\"bg-blue-500 text-#333\">\n```\n\n### Design System Architecture\n\n**Token Structure:**\n```css\n/* Colors */\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}  /* --color-primary-500 */\n\n/* Spacing */\n--spacing-{size}  /* Use Tailwind scale */\n\n/* Typography */\n--font-{family}  /* --font-sans */\n--text-{size}    /* --text-base */\n```\n\n**Token Usage:**\n```vue\n<!-- Correct -->\n<div class=\"bg-[var(--color-primary-500)] text-[var(--color-text-primary)]\">\n\n<!-- Incorrect -->\n<div class=\"bg-blue-500 text-gray-900\">\n```\n\n### Accessibility Standards\n\n**Required for ALL components:**\n- Semantic HTML (proper elements: button, nav, article, etc.)\n- ARIA labels when semantic HTML insufficient\n- Full keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrows)\n- Focus indicators (visible, high contrast)\n- Color contrast: 4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI minimum (target 7:1 for AAA)\n- Touch targets: 44x44px minimum\n\n## Workflow Integration\n\n### Available Subagents\nYou have access to specialized subagents:\n\n**ui-analyzer**: Design analysis, token validation, pattern recognition\n- Use for: Searching existing components, validating tokens, finding patterns\n- When: Before creating any new component\n\n**ui-builder**: Component generation (3 variants per request)\n- Use for: Generating Vue components with strict patterns\n- When: After planning is approved\n\n**ui-validator**: Quality scoring, visual testing, compliance checks\n- Use for: Validating components, capturing screenshots, regression testing\n- When: After component creation or modification\n\n**ui-documenter**: Documentation generation\n- Use for: Creating component API docs\n- When: Component is complete and validated\n\n### Available Commands\nReference these commands naturally when appropriate:\n\n- `/ui-plan` - Strategic planning before creation\n- `/ui-create` - Full creation pipeline (plan → generate → refine → validate)\n- `/ui-variants` - Generate N variant options\n- `/ui-review` - Comprehensive quality review\n- `/ui-compose` - Compose existing components\n- `/ui-batch-update` - Update multiple components consistently\n- `/ui-screenshot` - Capture component screenshots\n- `/ui-visual-regression` - Visual diff testing\n- `/ui-validate-tokens` - Design system compliance checking\n- `/ui-provider-refactor` - Convert to provider pattern\n- `/ui-document` - Generate documentation\n\n## Proactive Behavior\n\n### Auto-invoke Subagents\nWithout being asked, use subagents when:\n\n**ui-analyzer** when:\n- User mentions creating new component → Search for similar first\n- User mentions colors/styling → Validate tokens\n- User asks \"what components exist\" → Search and list\n\n**ui-validator** when:\n- Component code is generated → Run quality check\n- User asks \"is this good\" → Provide scored review\n- Visual changes made → Suggest screenshot/regression test\n\n**ui-documenter** when:\n- Component is finalized → Offer to document\n- User asks about component API → Generate docs\n\n### Suggest Best Practices\nProactively mention when:\n- User is about to duplicate code → Suggest composition\n- Hardcoded values detected → Suggest tokens\n- Missing accessibility → Point out WCAG requirements\n- Performance could improve → Suggest v-memo or lazy loading\n\n## Decision-Making\n\n### When to Search vs. Create\n**Search first if:**\n- Request matches common UI patterns (button, card, modal, input)\n- Similar components likely exist\n- User doesn't explicitly say \"new\" or \"from scratch\"\n\n**Create directly if:**\n- User explicitly says \"new\" or \"from scratch\"\n- Very specific/unique requirement\n- Search would obviously find nothing\n\n### When to Show Variants\nAlways show 3 variants when:\n- Creating new component\n- User requests options or variations\n- Multiple approaches are valid\n\nShow 1 solution when:\n- Modifying existing component\n- Single obvious best approach\n- User explicitly requests one solution\n\n### When to Refactor\nSuggest refactoring when you notice:\n- 3+ components with >80% code similarity → Provider pattern\n- Duplicated styling → Consolidate to base component\n- Hardcoded platform-specific logic → Configuration-driven\n- Token violations → Token migration\n\n## Error Prevention\n\n### Before Generating Code\n✅ Search for existing solutions\n✅ Verify design tokens available\n✅ Confirm component category/location\n✅ Check accessibility requirements\n✅ Plan prop interface\n\n### During Code Generation\n✅ Full TypeScript typing\n✅ All design tokens from system\n✅ Proper ARIA labels\n✅ Keyboard navigation\n✅ Computed reactive classes\n✅ Error handling\n\n### After Code Generation\n✅ Validate with ui-validator\n✅ Check quality score ≥95\n✅ Verify token compliance 100%\n✅ Test accessibility\n✅ Suggest visual regression test\n\n## Example Interactions\n\n### Creating Component (Ideal Flow)\n\n**User**: Create a badge component with status colors\n\n**You**: \nLet me search for existing badge or status components first.\n\n[Invoke ui-analyzer subagent to search]\n\n**Analysis Results:**\n- Found `StatusIndicator.vue` with color variants\n- No exact badge component exists\n- Can compose or create new\n\n**Recommendation**: Create new BadgeComponent since StatusIndicator is too specific.\n\nReady to generate 3 variants:\n1. Minimal - Simple text badge\n2. Feature-rich - With icons and close button\n3. Accessible - WCAG AAA with full keyboard support\n\nProceed? (yes/no)\n\n---\n\n### Reviewing Component\n\n**User**: Review this component [code]\n\n**You**:\n[Invoke ui-validator immediately]\n\n**Quality Score: 87/100**\n\n**Issues:**\n🔴 Line 23: Hardcoded color `#3B82F6` → Use `var(--color-primary-500)`\n🟡 Line 45: Missing `aria-label` on icon button\n✅ Good TypeScript typing and structure\n\n**Auto-fixable**: Yes (hardcoded color)\n\nFix now? (yes/no)\n\n---\n\n### Composition Suggestion\n\n**User**: Create Instagram card component\n\n**You**:\nBefore creating, I notice you have FacebookCard, TwitterCard already. These are 90% identical.\n\n**Better approach**: Refactor to provider pattern instead:\n- Create `BaseProviderCard.vue` (reusable)\n- Add Instagram to `providers.ts` config (10 lines)\n- 67% code reduction\n\nCreate provider pattern or just Instagram card? (provider/card)\n\n---\n\n## Quality Standards\n\nEvery component you generate should score ≥95/100 on:\n\n1. **TypeScript Compliance** (10/10) - Full strict typing\n2. **Design Token Usage** (10/10) - 100% token compliance\n3. **Accessibility** (9-10/10) - WCAG AAA target\n4. **Code Structure** (10/10) - Clean Composition API\n5. **Performance** (9-10/10) - Optimized rendering\n6. **Error Handling** (9-10/10) - Graceful degradation\n7. **Reusability** (9-10/10) - Generic and flexible\n8. **Documentation** (8-10/10) - JSDoc comments\n9. **Test Coverage** (8-10/10) - Testable structure\n10. **Visual Polish** (9-10/10) - Consistent design\n\n## Remember\n\n- **You are a design system expert**, not a generic coder\n- **Quality over speed** - Take time to do it right\n- **Composition over creation** - Reuse everything possible\n- **Plan first** - Never jump straight to code\n- **Proactive** - Use subagents and suggest improvements\n- **Concise** - Respect the user's time\n- **Standards-driven** - Design system compliance is non-negotiable\n\nNow, focus on helping build production-ready Vue 3 components with excellence.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":3,"oldLines":6,"newStart":3,"newLines":13,"lines":[" description: Transform Claude into a UI/UX design system expert for Vue 3 component development with strict design patterns and quality standards"," ---"," ","+---","+**SOCIALAIZE-SPECIFIC VERSION**","+Updated: October 22, 2025","+This workflow uses Socialaize stack - see SOCIALAIZE_UI_SYSTEM_v3.md for tech details","+Part 1 Status: ✅ Complete (Tailwind config enhanced)","+---","+"," You are a UI/UX design system expert and senior Vue 3 developer specializing in building production-ready components for the Socialaize project."," "," ## Core Identity"]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Identify unique aspects:\n   - Platform-specific colors\n   - Different icons\n   - Unique labels\n   - Platform IDs\n\n### Step 2: Design Provider Config\n1. Create providers configuration file\n2. Define config shape:\n   ```typescript\n   interface ProviderConfig {\n     name: string\n     icon: string\n     color: string\n     gradient?: string\n     apiEndpoint?: string\n     // Platform-specific properties\n   }\n   ```\n3. Extract all unique values per platform\n\n### Step 3: Build Base Component (ui-builder)\n1. Create generic `BaseProviderCard.vue`\n2. Accept platform prop\n3. Load config from providers file\n4. Dynamic rendering based on config\n5. Maintain all original functionality\n6. Add type safety\n\n### Step 4: Create Providers Config\n1. Build `src/config/providers.ts`\n2. Define all platform configurations\n3. Export typed providers object\n4. Document config structure\n\n### Step 5: Migration Plan\n1. Test base component with all platforms\n2. Update imports across codebase\n3. Delete deprecated components\n4. Update documentation\n\n### Step 6: Validation\n1. Verify feature parity\n2. Check type safety\n3. Test all platforms\n4.

docs\n2. **Share for review**: Use for design approval\n3. **Set as baseline**: Use for visual regression testing\n4. **Update regularly**: Capture after major changes\n\n**Screenshot saved to**: `screenshots/ComponentName.png`\n\\```\n\n## Screenshot Best Practices\n\n### Preparation\n✅ **Clean state**: No external data or API calls\n✅ **Representative props**: Use realistic example data\n✅ **Design system applied**: All tokens loaded\n✅ **Animations complete**: Wait for transitions\n\n### Capture Settings\n✅ **Consistent viewport**: Always use same size\n✅ **Disable animations**: For consistent screenshots\n✅ **Wait for rendering**: Ensure component is fully loaded\n✅ **Clip to component**: Don't capture entire page\n\n### File Management\n✅ **Organized directories**: Group by component type\n✅ **Clear naming**: `ComponentName-state-viewport.png`\n✅ **Version control**: Commit screenshots with code\n✅ **Optimize size**: Compress images if large\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Issue: Screenshot is blank\n**Solution**: Increase wait timeout\n```typescript\nawait page.waitForSelector('[data-testid=\"component\"]', {\n  timeout: 15000\n})\n```\n\n### Issue: Component not styled\n**Solution**: Ensure design-system.css is loaded\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"/src/styles/design-system.css\" />\n```\n\n### Issue: Screenshot shows loading state\n**Solution**: Wait for async data\n```typescript\nawait page.waitForLoadState('networkidle')\n```\n\n### Issue: Playwright fails on Mac Pro\n**Solution**: Add GPU optimization flags\n```typescript\nlaunchOptions: {\n  args: ['--disable-gpu', '--no-sandbox']\n}\n```\n\n## Automation\n\n### Git Hook (Optional)\nCapture screenshot on component changes:\n\n```bash\n# .claude/hooks/after-edit.sh\n#!/bin/bash\n\nif [[ $EDITED_FILE == *\".vue\" ]]; then\n  echo \"Capturing screenshot for $EDITED_FILE...\"\n  npx playwright test tests/screenshots/capture.spec.ts\nfi\n```\n\n### CI/CD Integration\n```yaml\n# .github/workflows/screenshots.yml\nname: Component Screenshots\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    paths:\n      - 'src/components/**/*.vue'\n\njobs:\n  screenshots:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps\n      - run: npm run screenshot\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        with:\n          name: screenshots\n          path: screenshots/\n```\n\n## Screenshot Gallery\n\nAuto-generate gallery of all component screenshots:\n\n```markdown\n# Component Gallery\n\n## Buttons\n![PrimaryButton](screenshots/PrimaryButton.png)\n![SecondaryButton](screenshots/SecondaryButton.png)\n\n## Cards\n![UserCard](screenshots/UserCard.png)\n![PostCard](screenshots/PostCard.png)\n\n[Auto-generated from /screenshots directory]\n```\n\n## Time Estimate\n\n- Setup preview: 1-2 minutes\n- Start dev server: 30 seconds\n- Capture screenshot: 30 seconds\n- Save and display: 30 seconds\n- **Total: 3-4 minutes**\n\nWith --all-states: 5-7 minutes\nWith --viewports: 6-8 minutes\n\n## Integration\n\nThis command uses:\n- **ui-validator** subagent for Playwright execution\n- Astro preview page for component rendering\n- Local dev server for live preview\n\nCan be used for:\n- Visual documentation\n- Design reviews\n- PR previews\n- Visual regression baselines\n- Component gallery\n\nQuick, easy, and essential for visual component

Update baseline with --update-baselines flag\n2. Document change in component changelog\n3. Update component documentation if needed\n4. Deploy to staging for testing\n\n**If Rejected:**\n1. Review recent code changes\n2. Check design token updates\n3. Fix unintended visual changes\n4. Re-run visual regression test\n\\```\n\n## Options\n\n### --update-baselines\nUpdate baseline screenshots without comparing:\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression Button.vue --update-baselines\n```\nUse after approved visual changes.\n\n### --threshold [value]\nSet custom difference threshold:\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression Button.vue --threshold 0.05\n```\nAllows up to 5% difference.\n\n### --ignore-antialiasing\nIgnore antialiasing differences:\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression Button.vue --ignore-antialiasing\n```\nUseful for cross-browser testing.\n\n### --all-components\nTest all components in project:\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression --all-components\n```\nRun full regression suite.\n\n## Thresholds & Tolerances\n\n### Default Tolerances\n```typescript\n{\n  maxDiffPixels: 100,          // Max individual pixels\n  maxDiffPixelRatio: 0.01,     // Max 1% of total pixels\n  threshold: 0.2,              // Per-pixel color threshold\n}\n```\n\n### Recommended Thresholds by Component Type\n\n**Buttons & Small Components**: 0.5% (very strict)\n**Cards & Medium Components**: 1.0% (standard)\n**Pages & Large Components**: 2.0% (lenient)\n**Animated Components**: 3.0% (allow frame variations)\n\n## Handling Common Differences\n\n### Antialiasing Differences\n```typescript\n// Increase threshold slightly\nthreshold: 0.3  // Instead of 0.2\n```\n\n### Font Rendering Variations\n```typescript\n// Use text diffing instead\ndiffStrategy: 'text-only'\n```\n\n### Dynamic Content (dates, random data)\n```typescript\n// Mask dynamic areas\nmask: [\n  { x: 10, y: 10, width: 100, height: 20 }  // Mask date display\n]\n```\n\n### Animation Frame Differences\n```typescript\n// Disable animations\nawait page.evaluate(() => {\n  document.body.style.setProperty('--animation-duration', '0s')\n})\n```\n\n## CI/CD Integration\n\n### GitHub Actions Workflow\n```yaml\nname: Visual Regression Tests\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    paths:\n      - 'src/components/**/*.vue'\n      - 'src/styles/**/*.css'\n\njobs:\n  visual-regression:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - uses: actions/checkout@v3\n      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3\n      - run: npm ci\n      - run: npx playwright install --with-deps\n      \n      # Run visual regression tests\n      - run: npm run test:visual\n      \n      # Upload diff images on failure\n      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3\n        if: failure()\n        with:\n          name: visual-diffs\n          path: tests/visual-diffs/\n          \n      # Comment on PR with results\n      - name: Comment PR\n        if: failure()\n        uses: actions/github-script@v6\n        with:\n          script: |\n            github.rest.issues.createComment({\n              issue_number: context.issue.number,\n              owner: context.repo.owner,\n              repo: context.repo.repo,\n              body: '⚠️ Visual regression tests failed. Check artifacts for diff images.'\n            })\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### DO:\n✅ **Establish baselines** - Capture good baseline first\n✅ **Review diffs carefully** - Don't blindly approve\n✅ **Update baselines deliberately** - Only for intentional changes\n✅ **Run before PRs** - Catch issues early\n✅ **Document changes** - Note why baseline updated\n\n### DON'T:\n❌ **Skip reviews** - Always review visual diffs\n❌ **Set threshold too high** - Defeats the purpose\n❌ **Ignore small changes** - They can compound\n❌ **Update without approval** - Get design approval first\n❌ **Test with animations** - Disable for consistency\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Issue: Too Many False Positives\n**Solution**: Adjust threshold or ignore antialiasing\n```typescript\nthreshold: 0.3,\nignoreAntialiasing: true\n```\n\n### Issue: Baselines Out of Date\n**Solution**: Batch update all baselines\n```bash\n/ui-visual-regression --all-components --update-baselines\n```\n\n### Issue: Cross-Browser Differences\n**Solution**: Maintain separate baselines per browser\n```\ntests/visual-baselines/\n  chromium/ComponentName.png\n  firefox/ComponentName.png\n  webkit/ComponentName.png\n```\n\n### Issue: Mac Pro Performance\n**Solution**: Use optimized Playwright config\n```typescript\nworkers: 1,\ntimeout: 60000,\nlaunchOptions: { args: ['--disable-gpu'] }\n```\n\n## Time Estimate\n\nPer component:\n- Baseline capture: 30 seconds\n- Current capture: 30 seconds\n- Comparison: 10 seconds\n- Diff generation: 10 seconds\n- **Total: 80 seconds**\n\nFor full suite (50 components): ~60-70 minutes\n\n## Integration\n\nThis command uses:\n- **ui-validator** subagent for Playwright execution\n- **pixelmatch** library for pixel comparison\n- Baseline management system\n- Diff visualization tools\n\nEssential for:\n- Preventing visual regressions\n- Design system compliance\n- Cross-browser consistency\n- PR quality gates\n\nCatch visual bugs before users do.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":4,"oldLines":6,"newStart":4,"newLines":13,"lines":[" allowed-tools: bash, read, write, view"," ---"," ","+---","+**SOCIALAIZE-SPECIFIC VERSION**","+Updated: October 22, 2025","+This workflow uses Socialaize stack - see SOCIALAIZE_UI_SYSTEM_v3.md for tech details","+Part 1 Status: ✅ Complete (Tailwind config enhanced)","+---","+"," # UI Visual Regression Testing"," "," Automated visual regression testing with pixel-perfect comparison, diff highlighting, and baseline management."]}],"userModified":false,"replaceAll":false}}

Context is precious.\n\n**Always /clear when:**\n```bash\n# After completing any feature\ngit commit -m \"Add authentication system\"\n/clear\n\n# Before starting unrelated tasks\n/clear\n\"Now let's work on the email notification system\"\n\n# When switching between unrelated areas\n# Example: Frontend → Backend → DevOps\n/clear\n\"Switch to backend API development\"\n\n# When Claude seems confused or loops\n/clear\n\"Let's start fresh. Here's what I need...\"\n\n# Before visual regression tests (reset mental model)\n/clear\n/ui-visual-regression [component-path]\n```\n\n**Don't /clear when:**\n- Mid-feature implementation\n- Iterating on same component\n- Following multi-step plan\n- Claude is actively debugging\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If your next prompt is unrelated to the last 5 messages, /clear first.\n```\n\n### 1.2 Scratchpad System\n\n```markdown\n### Task Planning: .temp Folder\n\nFor complex multi-step tasks, externalize planning to save context for execution.\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```bash\n.temp/\n├── REFACTOR_PAD.md      # Current refactor planning\n├── DASHBOARD_PAD.md     # Dashboard feature planning\n├── MIGRATION_PAD.md     # Migration planning\n└── [TASK]_PAD.md        # Any task-specific scratchpad\n```\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n```bash\n# Start complex task\n\"Plan the provider pattern refactor in .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\"\n\n# Claude creates structured plan:\n## Task: Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n### Analysis\n- Current state: 57 duplicate platform components\n- What needs to change: Consolidate to BaseProviderCard + config\n- Potential issues: Testing, migration path\n\n### Plan\n1. Create BaseProviderCard component with slot system\n2. Create providers.ts configuration\n3. Migrate Facebook components (test)\n4. Migrate remaining platforms\n5. Remove deprecated files\n\n### Files to Modify\n- src/components/vue/base/BaseProviderCard.vue (NEW)\n- src/config/providers.ts (NEW)\n- src/components/vue/cards/FacebookCard.vue (REFACTOR)\n- [... 56 more files]\n\n### Validation\n- [ ] All platforms render correctly\n- [ ] Props pass through properly\n- [ ] Visual regression tests pass\n- [ ] Console errors clear\n\n# Review and approve\n\"Looks good, proceed with step 1\"\n\n# Claude executes step 1\n\n# Continue iteratively\n\"Show me what changed, then move to step 2\"\n\n# When complete, cleanup\nrm .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- Planning is explicit and reviewable\n- Can pause/resume at any step\n- Context focused on execution, not planning\n- Can /clear between steps without losing plan\n- Works for ANY complex task\n\n**Examples across workflows:**\n```bash\n# Component refactor\n\"Plan the modal redesign in .temp/MODAL_PAD.md\"\n\n# Multi-file change\n\"Plan the authentication flow in .temp/AUTH_PAD.md\"\n\n# Migration\n\"Plan the Tailwind v4 upgrade in .temp/UPGRADE_PAD.md\"\n```\n```\n\n### 1.3 Persistent Decisions\n\n```markdown\n### Permanent Decisions: .claude/decisions.md\n\nFor architectural decisions that should persist across sessions.\n\n**Create:** `.claude/decisions.md`\n\n**Only document:**\n- Technology choices (why X over Y)\n- Architecture patterns (why we structure things this way)\n- Breaking changes (what changed and why)\n- Failed approaches (so Claude doesn't retry them)\n\n**Format:**\n```markdown\n## [Decision Name] - [YYYY-MM-DD]\n\n**Context:** What prompted this decision\n**Decision:** What we decided to do\n**Reasoning:** Why we made this choice\n**Alternatives Considered:** What we didn't choose and why\n**Impact:** What this affects\n\n---\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```markdown\n## Nanostore Over Pinia - 2025-10-15\n\n**Context:** Need global state management for user auth and theme\n\n**Decision:** Use Nanostore instead of Pinia\n\n**Reasoning:**\n- Lighter weight (1kb vs 10kb)\n- Framework agnostic (works with Astro pages)\n- Simpler API for our use case\n- No Vue-specific coupling\n\n**Alternatives Considered:**\n- Pinia: Too heavy, Vue-specific\n- Vuex: Deprecated\n- Context/Provide: Doesn't work across Astro boundaries\n\n**Impact:** All global state uses Nanostore atoms\n\n---\n```\n\n**When to add:**\n- Once per major decision\n- Not for every component choice\n- Focus on \"why\" not \"what\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎨 Part 2: Core Design Principles\n\n> **Location:** Add to `/CLAUDE.md` and update `design-system.css`  \n> **Benefit:** Professional UI quality, consistent visual language\n\n### 2.1 Depth Through Shadows (No Borders)\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 UI Design Principles\n\n### Depth Through Shadows & Color Layering\n\n**Problem:** Borders make UIs look flat and dated.\n\n**Solution:** Use shadows and color layering to create depth.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. Generate 3-4 shades for each base color\n2. Darker shades = background layers\n3. Lighter shades = foreground elements  \n4. Eliminate borders where possible\n5. Use dual-shadow system (light + dark)\n\n**Shadow System:**\n```css\n/* Three-tier shadow system */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);           /* Subtle elevation */\n--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),\n             0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);            /* Standard cards */\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n             0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);             /* Modals, popovers */\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15),\n             0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);           /* Hero sections */\n```\n\n**Tailwind pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Old: Borders -->\n<div class=\"border border-gray-300 rounded-lg\">\n\n<!-- ✅ New: Shadows + Color Layers -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 shadow-md rounded-lg\">\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg p-6\">\n    <!-- Content on lighter bg = elevated -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Color layering pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- Page → Section → Card → Content -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50\">              <!-- Darkest (page bg) -->\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-100 shadow-sm\">  <!-- Section bg -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white shadow-md\">   <!-- Card bg -->\n      <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-4\">     <!-- Elevated content -->\n        <!-- Lightest = highest elevation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**When borders ARE okay:**\n- Input fields (functional affordance)\n- Focus states (accessibility requirement)\n- Table cells (data separation)\n- Dividers (semantic separation)\n\n**Prompt pattern for Claude:**\n\"Use shadow-md and color layering (bg-gray-50/100) for depth. Avoid borders except for inputs and focus states.\"\n```\n\n### 2.2 Semantic Color Palette\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Semantic Color Palette System\n\n**Define 4 color types before any design work:**\n\n1. **Primary** — CTAs, key actions, brand identity\n2. **Secondary** — Subtle highlights, accents, secondary actions\n3. **Neutral** — Backgrounds, text, UI chrome (grays)\n4. **Semantic** — States (success, warning, error, info)\n\n**Token structure:**\n```css\n/* Primary (Brand) */\n--color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n--color-primary-500: #ef4444;   /* Base - buttons, links */\n--color-primary-600: #dc2626;   /* Hover state */\n--color-primary-700: #b91c1c;   /* Active state */\n--color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n\n/* Secondary (Accent) */\n--color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n--color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;  /* Base */\n--color-secondary-600: #0d9488;  /* Hover */\n\n/* Neutral (Grays) */\n--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;    /* Page background */\n--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;   /* Section background */\n--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;   /* Card background */\n--color-neutral-300: #d4d4d4;   /* Input borders */\n--color-neutral-400: #a3a3a3;   /* Disabled text */\n--color-neutral-500: #737373;   /* Secondary text */\n--color-neutral-700: #404040;   /* Body text */\n--color-neutral-900: #171717;   /* Headings */\n\n/* Semantic (States) */\n--color-success-50: #f0fdf4;\n--color-success-500: #22c55e;   /* Success messages */\n--color-warning-50: #fffbeb;\n--color-warning-500: #f59e0b;   /* Warning messages */\n--color-error-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-error-500: #ef4444;     /* Error messages */\n--color-info-50: #eff6ff;\n--color-info-500: #3b82f6;      /* Info messages */\n```\n\n**Usage rules:**\n- Primary: 1-2 uses per screen (CTAs only)\n- Secondary: Supporting actions, badges, highlights\n- Neutral: Everything else (80% of UI)\n- Semantic: State feedback only (not decoration)\n\n**Tailwind mapping:**\n```vue\n<!-- Primary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700\">\n\n<!-- Secondary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600\">\n\n<!-- Backgrounds (depth layering) -->\n<div class=\"bg-neutral-50\">        <!-- Page -->\n  <div class=\"bg-neutral-100\">     <!-- Section -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white\">         <!-- Card -->\n\n<!-- Semantic states -->\n<div class=\"bg-success-50 text-success-700 border border-success-200\">\n  ✓ Success message\n</div>\n```\n```\n\n### 2.3 Priority-Based Mobile Rearrangement\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Mobile-First: Priority Rearrangement\n\n**Problem:** Treating responsive as \"make it smaller\" produces bad mobile UX.\n\n**Solution:** Reorganize by priority on mobile, don't just shrink.\n\n**Priority system:**\n1. **Critical** — Primary action, key info (always visible)\n2. **Important** — Secondary actions, supporting content (visible but demoted)\n3. **Optional** — Tertiary features, extra info (collapsed/hidden)\n\n**Desktop vs Mobile structure:**\n```vue\n<!-- Desktop: Side-by-side layout -->\n<div class=\"lg:flex lg:gap-8\">\n  <aside class=\"lg:w-64\">\n    <!-- Filters, secondary nav -->\n  </aside>\n  <main class=\"lg:flex-1\">\n    <!-- Primary content -->\n  </main>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: Stacked by priority -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <!-- 1. Search/filter (critical - user intent) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <SearchBar />\n  </div>\n  \n  <!-- 2. Primary content (most important) -->\n  <main>\n    <ContentGrid />\n  </main>\n  \n  <!-- 3. Filters (collapsible - optional) -->\n  <details class=\"md:hidden\">\n    <summary>Filters</summary>\n    <FilterPanel />\n  </details>\n  \n  <!-- 4. Secondary nav (bottom sheet - tertiary) -->\n  <div class=\"md:hidden fixed bottom-0\">\n    <BottomNav />\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Common mobile patterns:**\n```vue\n<!-- Pattern 1: Fixed bottom CTA (mobile) -->\n<button class=\"\n  md:static md:inline-flex\n  fixed bottom-4 left-4 right-4 w-auto\n  md:w-auto\n\">\n  Primary Action\n</button>\n\n<!-- Pattern 2: Horizontal scroll (mobile cards) -->\n<div class=\"\n  flex gap-4 overflow-x-auto md:grid md:grid-cols-3\n  snap-x snap-mandatory\n\">\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n  <div class=\"snap-start min-w-[280px] md:min-w-0\">Card</div>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pattern 3: Collapsible sections (mobile) -->\n<div class=\"md:block hidden\">\n  <!-- Always visible on desktop -->\n</div>\n<details class=\"md:hidden\">\n  <summary class=\"font-medium cursor-pointer\">\n    Show Additional Info\n  </summary>\n  <div class=\"mt-4\">\n    <!-- Collapsed on mobile -->\n  </div>\n</details>\n```\n\n**Breakpoint strategy:**\n- `< 640px` (mobile): Single column, stacked by priority\n- `640-768px` (tablet): 2 columns or expanded single column\n- `> 768px` (desktop): Full layout with sidebars\n\n**Testing checklist:**\n- [ ] Critical actions visible without scrolling (mobile)\n- [ ] Content readable without zoom\n- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- [ ] No horizontal scroll (except intentional carousels)\n- [ ] Form inputs don't cause zoom on iOS\n```\n\n### 2.4 Update design-system.css\n\nAdd these tokens to `src/styles/design-system.css`:\n\n```css\n/* Add to design-system.css */\n\n/* ========================================\n   DEPTH SYSTEM (Shadows)\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Shadow scale */\n  --shadow-xs: 0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-sm: 0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n  --shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07),\n               0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1),\n               0 4px 6px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.05);\n  --shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15),\n               0 10px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);\n  --shadow-2xl: 0 25px 50px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);\n  \n  /* Inner shadows for depth inversion */\n  --shadow-inner: inset 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);\n}\n\n/* ========================================\n   SEMANTIC COLOR PALETTE\n   ======================================== */\n\n:root {\n  /* Primary (Brand/CTA) */\n  --color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n  --color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n  --color-primary-200: #fecaca;\n  --color-primary-300: #fca5a5;\n  --color-primary-400: #f87171;\n  --color-primary-500: #ef4444;\n  --color-primary-600: #dc2626;\n  --color-primary-700: #b91c1c;\n  --color-primary-800: #991b1b;\n  --color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n  \n  /* Secondary (Accent) */\n  --color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n  --color-secondary-100: #ccfbf1;\n  --color-secondary-200: #99f6e4;\n  --color-secondary-300: #5eead4;\n  --color-secondary-400: #2dd4bf;\n  --color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;\n  --color-secondary-600: #0d9488;\n  --color-secondary-700: #0f766e;\n  --color-secondary-800: #115e59;\n  --color-secondary-900: #134e4a;\n  \n  /* Neutral (Grays) -

Faster = more responsive feel.\n\n### Easing Functions\n\n```vue\n<!-- Ease Out (MOST COMMON) - Ending animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\">\n  <!-- Elements leaving, fading out, dropdown close -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In - Starting animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\">\n  <!-- Elements entering, fading in -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In-Out - Continuous motion -->\n<div class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out\">\n  <!-- Sliding panels, moving elements -->\n</div>\n```\n\n**Default:** Use `ease-out` for 90% of animations.\n\n### What to Animate\n\n**✅ Animate these (performant):**\n- `opacity` — Fades\n- `transform` — Move, scale, rotate\n- `max-height` — Accordions (with overflow-hidden)\n- `filter` — Blur, brightness (use sparingly)\n\n**❌ Don't animate these (causes reflow):**\n- `width`, `height` — Use `scale` instead\n- `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` — Use `transform: translate` instead\n- `padding`, `margin` — Causes layout shift\n\n### Common Animation Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Fade In/Out -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Content</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Down (Dropdown) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"isOpen\">Dropdown</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Scale In (Modal) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showModal\">Modal</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Up (Bottom Sheet) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n  leave-to-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showSheet\">Bottom Sheet</div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n### Accordion Pattern (Smooth Height)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst isOpen = ref(false)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"isOpen = !isOpen\">\n      Toggle Accordion\n    </button>\n    \n    <div\n      :class=\"[\n        'overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out',\n        isOpen ?

Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Spinning loader -->\n<div class=\"\n  w-8 h-8\n  border-4 border-neutral-200\n  border-t-primary-600\n  rounded-full\n  animate-spin\n\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pulsing loader (skeleton) -->\n<div class=\"\n  h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded\n  animate-pulse\n\">\n</div>\n```\n\n### Page Transition Pattern (Astro)\n\n```vue\n<!-- In Astro layout -->\n<div class=\"\n  animate-in fade-in duration-300\n\">\n  <slot />\n</div>\n```\n\n### Motion Preferences (Accessibility)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Respect prefers-reduced-motion -->\n<style>\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  * {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Animation Checklist\n\nWhen adding animations:\n- [ ] Duration is 150-300ms (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using `opacity` or `transform` (not width/height)\n- [ ] Easing is appropriate (ease-out for most)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show)\n```\n\n### 3.4 Spacing & Layout System\n\n```markdown\n## Spatial Rhythm System\n\n### Core Spacing Scale (Tailwind)\n\n**Use ONLY these values:** 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64\n\n**Avoid:** 5, 7, 10, 14, 20 (inconsistent, breaks rhythm)\n\n| Value | Pixels | Class | Use Case |\n|-------|--------|-------|----------|\n| 0.5 | 2px | `gap-0.5`, `p-0.5` | Micro spacing |\n| 1 | 4px | `gap-1`, `p-1` | Very tight |\n| 2 | 8px | `gap-2`, `p-2` | Tight groups (icon + text) |\n| 3 | 12px | `gap-3`, `p-3` | Compact spacing |\n| 4 | 16px | `gap-4`, `p-4` | Standard spacing (DEFAULT) |\n| 6 | 24px | `gap-6`, `p-6` | Comfortable spacing |\n| 8 | 32px | `gap-8`, `p-8` | Generous spacing |\n| 12 | 48px | `gap-12`, `p-12` | Section breaks |\n| 16 | 64px | `gap-16`, `p-16` | Major divisions |\n\n### Component Internal Spacing (gap)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Icon + Text (tight)

(justify) -->\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n  <h2>Title</h2>\n  <button>Action</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Container Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Page Container (max-width) -->\n<div class=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Section Container (breathing room) -->\n<section class=\"py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-24\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</section>\n\n<!-- Card Container -->\n<div class=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n  <!-- Centered card -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Spacing Decision Tree\n\n**Use `gap-2`:** Icon + text, tight button groups  \n**Use `gap-4`:** Form fields, related elements (DEFAULT)  \n**Use `gap-6`:** Card sections, distinct groups  \n**Use `gap-8`:** Major page sections  \n**Use `gap-12`+:** Hero sections, full-page breaks\n\n**Padding hierarchy:**  \n`p-4` → Mobile/compact  \n`p-6` → Standard (DEFAULT)  \n`p-8` → Spacious/desktop\n\n**Margin hierarchy:**  \n`mb-4` → Between elements  \n`mb-6` → Between groups  \n`mb-8` → Between sections  \n`mb-12`+ → Between major blocks\n```\n\n### 3.5 Icon System\n\n```markdown\n## Icon System Guidelines\n\n### Icon Library\n\n**Recommended:** Lucide Icons (clean,

</template>\n</Card>\n```\n\n### Scoped Slots (Data Passing)\n\n```vue\n<!-- DataList.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  items: Array<any>\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n    <div\n      v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n      :key=\"item.id\"\n    >\n      <slot :item=\"item\" :index=\"index\"

</template>\n</DataList>\n```\n\n### Fallback Content Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Alert.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.icon\" class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <slot name=\"icon\" />\n    </div>\n    <div v-else class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <!-- Default icon -->\n      <AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"alert-content\">\n      <slot>\n        <!-- Fallback if no content provided -->\n        <p>No message provided</p>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Conditional Slots Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Modal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useSlots } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst hasActions = computed(() => !!slots.actions)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div

When to Use Slots\n\n**Use slots when:**\n- ✅ Content structure varies significantly\n- ✅ Parent needs control over rendering\n- ✅ Building flexible, reusable components\n- ✅ Creating compound components (Card, Modal, Tabs)\n\n**Use props when:**\n- ✅ Data is simple (strings, numbers, booleans)\n- ✅ Component has fixed structure\n- ✅ Configuration over composition\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Part

Animation Constants (src/constants/animations.ts)\n\n```typescript\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\n// Duration presets\nANIMATION_DURATION.INSTANT  // 100ms - Very quick state changes\nANIMATION_DURATION.FAST     // 200ms - Most common (buttons, hovers)\nANIMATION_DURATION.NORMAL   // 300ms - Modals, dropdowns\nANIMATION_DURATION.SLOW     // 500ms - Page transitions\n\n// Easing presets\nEASING.EASE_OUT    // Most common - elements settling\nEASING.SMOOTH      // Smooth transitions\nEASING.BOUNCE      // Playful effects\nEASING.ELASTIC     // Spring effects\n```\n\n#### 2. Web Animations API (useAnimateElement)\n\nFor complex, orchestrated animations:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\nconst element = ref<HTMLElement>()\nconst { animate } = useAnimateElement()\n\nconst handleClick = () => {\n  animate(element.value, 'fadeIn', {\n    duration: ANIMATION_DURATION.FAST,\n    easing: EASING.EASE_OUT\n  })\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div ref=\"element\">Animated content</div>\n</template>\n```\n\n#### 3. Animation Presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n\nAvailable presets in `src/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimationPresets.ts`:\n\n- **slideUp** - Slide element up from bottom\n- **slideDown** - Slide element down from top\n- **fadeIn** - Fade in with opacity\n- **scaleUp** - Scale up from center\n- **scaleDown** - Scale down to center\n- **staggerFadeIn** - Sequential fade-in for lists\n- **popIn** - Playful pop-in effect\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useAnimationPresets } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimationPresets'\n\nconst { fadeInPreset, slideUpPreset } = useAnimationPresets()\n\n// Use preset directly\nelement.value?.animate(fadeInPreset.keyframes, fadeInPreset.options)\n</script>\n```\n\n#### 4. VueUse Motion (Already Installed)\n\nFor declarative component-level animations:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useMotion } from '@vueuse/motion'\n\nconst target = ref()\n\nconst { variant } = useMotion(target, {\n  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  enter: {\n    opacity: 1,\n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 200,\n      ease: 'easeOut'\n    }\n  }\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div ref=\"target\">\n    Content with enter animation\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n#### 5. Tailwind Animation Utilities (NEW from Part 1)\n\nFor simple transitions and pre-built animations:\n\n```vue\n<!-- Transition utilities -->\n<div class=\"transition-fast ease-smooth\">\n  <!-- Fast transition with smooth easing -->\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"transition-medium ease-out\">\n  <!-- Medium speed transition -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pre-built animations -->\n<div class=\"animate-fade-in\">\n  <!-- Fade in animation -->\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"animate-slide-in-up\">\n  <!-- Slide in from bottom -->\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"animate-spin\">\n  <!-- Spinning loader -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Animation Decision Tree\n\nChoose the right approach for your use case:\n\n**Simple transitions (hover, focus, state changes):**\n→ Use Tailwind utilities: `transition-fast hover:scale-105`\n\n**Component enter/exit animations:**\n→ Use VueUse Motion: `useMotion()` with initial/enter variants\n\n**Complex sequences or orchestrated animations:**\n→ Use Web Animations API: `useAnimateElement()` with custom timing\n\n**Standard effects (fade, slide, scale):**\n→ Use animation presets: `import { fadeInPreset } from '@/composables/useAnimationPresets'`\n\n**List/stagger animations:**\n→ Use staggerFadeIn preset or VueUse Motion's stagger features\n\n### Common Animation Patterns (Socialaize)\n\n#### Vue Transition with Tailwind\n\n```vue\n<!-- Fade In/Out -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-fast ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-fast ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Content</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Down (Dropdown) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-medium ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-fast ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"isOpen\">Dropdown</div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n#### Loading States\n\n```vue\n<!-- Spinning loader with Icon -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <Icon icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"w-6 h-6 animate-spin text-primary-600\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n#### Accordion with Smooth Height\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nimport { useMotion } from '@vueuse/motion'\n\nconst isOpen = ref(false)\nconst content = ref()\n\nuseMotion(content, {\n  initial: { height: 0, opacity: 0 },\n  enter: { height: 'auto', opacity: 1 }\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"isOpen = !isOpen\">Toggle</button>\n    <div v-if=\"isOpen\" ref=\"content\" class=\"overflow-hidden\">\n      <div class=\"p-4\">Accordion content</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Motion Preferences (Accessibility)\n\nAlways respect user preferences:\n\n```vue\n<!-- Global CSS (already in design-system.css) -->\n<style>\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  *,\n  *::before,\n  *::after {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Animation Checklist (Socialaize)\n\nWhen adding animations:\n- [ ] Used ANIMATION_DURATION constants (not hardcoded values)\n- [ ] Used EASING constants (not custom cubic-bezier)\n- [ ] Chose appropriate method (Tailwind vs VueUse vs Web Animations)\n- [ ] Duration is 100-300ms for most UI (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using performant properties (`opacity`, `transform`)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show properly)\n- [ ] Checked existing presets before creating custom animation\n```","originalFile":"# 🚀 Socialaize UI System v3 Enhancements\n\n> **Purpose:** Lean, actionable improvements to v3 UI design system  \n> **Scope:** ~700 lines of targeted enhancements  \n> **Time to Implement:** 3-4 hours  \n> **Approach:** Enhance existing files, no system rewrites  \n> **Last Updated:** October 22, 2025\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Table of Contents\n\n1.

Context is precious.\n\n**Always /clear when:**\n```bash\n# After completing any feature\ngit commit -m \"Add authentication system\"\n/clear\n\n# Before starting unrelated tasks\n/clear\n\"Now let's work on the email notification system\"\n\n# When switching between unrelated areas\n# Example: Frontend → Backend → DevOps\n/clear\n\"Switch to backend API development\"\n\n# When Claude seems confused or loops\n/clear\n\"Let's start fresh. Here's what I need...\"\n\n# Before visual regression tests (reset mental model)\n/clear\n/ui-visual-regression [component-path]\n```\n\n**Don't /clear when:**\n- Mid-feature implementation\n- Iterating on same component\n- Following multi-step plan\n- Claude is actively debugging\n\n**Rule of Thumb:** If your next prompt is unrelated to the last 5 messages, /clear first.\n```\n\n### 1.2 Scratchpad System\n\n```markdown\n### Task Planning: .temp Folder\n\nFor complex multi-step tasks, externalize planning to save context for execution.\n\n**Directory structure:**\n```bash\n.temp/\n├── REFACTOR_PAD.md      # Current refactor planning\n├── DASHBOARD_PAD.md     # Dashboard feature planning\n├── MIGRATION_PAD.md     # Migration planning\n└── [TASK]_PAD.md        # Any task-specific scratchpad\n```\n\n**Usage pattern:**\n```bash\n# Start complex task\n\"Plan the provider pattern refactor in .temp/REFACTOR_PAD.md\"\n\n# Claude creates structured plan:\n## Task: Provider Pattern Refactor\n\n### Analysis\n- Current state: 57 duplicate platform components\n- What needs to change: Consolidate to BaseProviderCard + config\n- Potential issues: Testing, migration path\n\n### Plan\n1. Create BaseProviderCard component with slot system\n2. Create providers.ts configuration\n3. Migrate Facebook components (test)\n4. Migrate remaining platforms\n5.

Generate 3-4 shades for each base color\n2. Darker shades = background layers\n3. Lighter shades = foreground elements  \n4. Eliminate borders where possible\n5. Use dual-shadow system (light + dark)\n\n**Shadow System:**\n```css\n/* Three-tier shadow system */\n--shadow-sm: 0 1px 2px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);           /* Subtle elevation */\n--shadow-md: 0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.07),\n             0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);            /* Standard cards */\n--shadow-lg: 0 10px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.1),\n             0 4px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.05);             /* Modals, popovers */\n--shadow-xl: 0 20px 25px rgba(0,0,0,0.15),\n             0 10px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);           /* Hero sections */\n```\n\n**Tailwind pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- ❌ Old: Borders -->\n<div class=\"border border-gray-300 rounded-lg\">\n\n<!-- ✅ New: Shadows + Color Layers -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50 shadow-md rounded-lg\">\n  <div class=\"bg-white rounded-lg p-6\">\n    <!-- Content on lighter bg = elevated -->\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**Color layering pattern:**\n```vue\n<!-- Page → Section → Card → Content -->\n<div class=\"bg-gray-50\">              <!-- Darkest (page bg) -->\n  <div class=\"bg-gray-100 shadow-sm\">  <!-- Section bg -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white shadow-md\">   <!-- Card bg -->\n      <div class=\"bg-gray-50 p-4\">     <!-- Elevated content -->\n        <!-- Lightest = highest elevation -->\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</div>\n```\n\n**When borders ARE okay:**\n- Input fields (functional affordance)\n- Focus states (accessibility requirement)\n- Table cells (data separation)\n- Dividers (semantic separation)\n\n**Prompt pattern for Claude:**\n\"Use shadow-md and color layering (bg-gray-50/100) for depth. Avoid borders except for inputs and focus states.\"\n```\n\n### 2.2 Semantic Color Palette\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Semantic Color Palette System\n\n**Define 4 color types before any design work:**\n\n1. **Primary** — CTAs, key actions, brand identity\n2. **Secondary** — Subtle highlights, accents, secondary actions\n3. **Neutral** — Backgrounds, text, UI chrome (grays)\n4. **Semantic** — States (success, warning, error, info)\n\n**Token structure:**\n```css\n/* Primary (Brand) */\n--color-primary-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-primary-100: #fee2e2;\n--color-primary-500: #ef4444;   /* Base - buttons, links */\n--color-primary-600: #dc2626;   /* Hover state */\n--color-primary-700: #b91c1c;   /* Active state */\n--color-primary-900: #7f1d1d;\n\n/* Secondary (Accent) */\n--color-secondary-50: #f0fdfa;\n--color-secondary-500: #14b8a6;  /* Base */\n--color-secondary-600: #0d9488;  /* Hover */\n\n/* Neutral (Grays) */\n--color-neutral-50: #fafafa;    /* Page background */\n--color-neutral-100: #f5f5f5;   /* Section background */\n--color-neutral-200: #e5e5e5;   /* Card background */\n--color-neutral-300: #d4d4d4;   /* Input borders */\n--color-neutral-400: #a3a3a3;   /* Disabled text */\n--color-neutral-500: #737373;   /* Secondary text */\n--color-neutral-700: #404040;   /* Body text */\n--color-neutral-900: #171717;   /* Headings */\n\n/* Semantic (States) */\n--color-success-50: #f0fdf4;\n--color-success-500: #22c55e;   /* Success messages */\n--color-warning-50: #fffbeb;\n--color-warning-500: #f59e0b;   /* Warning messages */\n--color-error-50: #fef2f2;\n--color-error-500: #ef4444;     /* Error messages */\n--color-info-50: #eff6ff;\n--color-info-500: #3b82f6;      /* Info messages */\n```\n\n**Usage rules:**\n- Primary: 1-2 uses per screen (CTAs only)\n- Secondary: Supporting actions, badges, highlights\n- Neutral: Everything else (80% of UI)\n- Semantic: State feedback only (not decoration)\n\n**Tailwind mapping:**\n```vue\n<!-- Primary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700\">\n\n<!-- Secondary actions -->\n<button class=\"bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600\">\n\n<!-- Backgrounds (depth layering) -->\n<div class=\"bg-neutral-50\">        <!-- Page -->\n  <div class=\"bg-neutral-100\">     <!-- Section -->\n    <div class=\"bg-white\">         <!-- Card -->\n\n<!-- Semantic states -->\n<div class=\"bg-success-50 text-success-700 border border-success-200\">\n  ✓ Success message\n</div>\n```\n```\n\n### 2.3 Priority-Based Mobile Rearrangement\n\nAdd to CLAUDE.md:\n\n```markdown\n### Mobile-First: Priority Rearrangement\n\n**Problem:** Treating responsive as \"make it smaller\" produces bad mobile UX.\n\n**Solution:** Reorganize by priority on mobile, don't just shrink.\n\n**Priority system:**\n1. **Critical** — Primary action, key info (always visible)\n2. **Important** — Secondary actions, supporting content (visible but demoted)\n3. **Optional** — Tertiary features, extra info (collapsed/hidden)\n\n**Desktop vs Mobile structure:**\n```vue\n<!-- Desktop: Side-by-side layout -->\n<div class=\"lg:flex lg:gap-8\">\n  <aside class=\"lg:w-64\">\n    <!-- Filters, secondary nav -->\n  </aside>\n  <main class=\"lg:flex-1\">\n    <!-- Primary content -->\n  </main>\n</div>\n\n<!-- Mobile: Stacked by priority -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <!-- 1.

Faster = more responsive feel.\n\n### Easing Functions\n\n```vue\n<!-- Ease Out (MOST COMMON) - Ending animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\">\n  <!-- Elements leaving, fading out, dropdown close -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In - Starting animations -->\n<div class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\">\n  <!-- Elements entering, fading in -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Ease In-Out - Continuous motion -->\n<div class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-in-out\">\n  <!-- Sliding panels, moving elements -->\n</div>\n```\n\n**Default:** Use `ease-out` for 90% of animations.\n\n### What to Animate\n\n**✅ Animate these (performant):**\n- `opacity` — Fades\n- `transform` — Move, scale, rotate\n- `max-height` — Accordions (with overflow-hidden)\n- `filter` — Blur, brightness (use sparingly)\n\n**❌ Don't animate these (causes reflow):**\n- `width`, `height` — Use `scale` instead\n- `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom` — Use `transform: translate` instead\n- `padding`, `margin` — Causes layout shift\n\n### Common Animation Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Fade In/Out -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-opacity duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Content</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Down (Dropdown) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-150 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"isOpen\">Dropdown</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Scale In (Modal) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-all duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-all duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 scale-95\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showModal\">Modal</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Up (Bottom Sheet) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-300 ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-transform duration-200 ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n  leave-to-class=\"translate-y-full\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"showSheet\">Bottom Sheet</div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n### Accordion Pattern (Smooth Height)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\n\nconst isOpen = ref(false)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"isOpen = !isOpen\">\n      Toggle Accordion\n    </button>\n    \n    <div\n      :class=\"[\n        'overflow-hidden transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out',\n        isOpen ?

Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Spinning loader -->\n<div class=\"\n  w-8 h-8\n  border-4 border-neutral-200\n  border-t-primary-600\n  rounded-full\n  animate-spin\n\">\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pulsing loader (skeleton) -->\n<div class=\"\n  h-4 bg-neutral-200 rounded\n  animate-pulse\n\">\n</div>\n```\n\n### Page Transition Pattern (Astro)\n\n```vue\n<!-- In Astro layout -->\n<div class=\"\n  animate-in fade-in duration-300\n\">\n  <slot />\n</div>\n```\n\n### Motion Preferences (Accessibility)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Respect prefers-reduced-motion -->\n<style>\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  * {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Animation Checklist\n\nWhen adding animations:\n- [ ] Duration is 150-300ms (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using `opacity` or `transform` (not width/height)\n- [ ] Easing is appropriate (ease-out for most)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show)\n```\n\n### 3.4 Spacing & Layout System\n\n```markdown\n## Spatial Rhythm System\n\n### Core Spacing Scale (Tailwind)\n\n**Use ONLY these values:** 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64\n\n**Avoid:** 5, 7, 10, 14, 20 (inconsistent, breaks rhythm)\n\n| Value | Pixels | Class | Use Case |\n|-------|--------|-------|----------|\n| 0.5 | 2px | `gap-0.5`, `p-0.5` | Micro spacing |\n| 1 | 4px | `gap-1`, `p-1` | Very tight |\n| 2 | 8px | `gap-2`, `p-2` | Tight groups (icon + text) |\n| 3 | 12px | `gap-3`, `p-3` | Compact spacing |\n| 4 | 16px | `gap-4`, `p-4` | Standard spacing (DEFAULT) |\n| 6 | 24px | `gap-6`, `p-6` | Comfortable spacing |\n| 8 | 32px | `gap-8`, `p-8` | Generous spacing |\n| 12 | 48px | `gap-12`, `p-12` | Section breaks |\n| 16 | 64px | `gap-16`, `p-16` | Major divisions |\n\n### Component Internal Spacing (gap)\n\n```vue\n<!-- Icon + Text (tight) -->\n<button class=\"flex items-center gap-2\">\n  <Icon class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n  <span>Button Text</span>\n</button>\n\n<!-- Form fields (related elements) -->\n<div class=\"space-y-4\">\n  <input

(justify) -->\n<div class=\"flex items-center justify-between\">\n  <h2>Title</h2>\n  <button>Action</button>\n</div>\n```\n\n### Container Patterns\n\n```vue\n<!-- Page Container (max-width) -->\n<div class=\"max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Section Container (breathing room) -->\n<section class=\"py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-24\">\n  <!-- Content -->\n</section>\n\n<!-- Card Container -->\n<div class=\"max-w-md mx-auto\">\n  <!-- Centered card -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Spacing Decision Tree\n\n**Use `gap-2`:** Icon + text, tight button groups  \n**Use `gap-4`:** Form fields, related elements (DEFAULT)  \n**Use `gap-6`:** Card sections, distinct groups  \n**Use `gap-8`:** Major page sections  \n**Use `gap-12`+:** Hero sections, full-page breaks\n\n**Padding hierarchy:**  \n`p-4` → Mobile/compact  \n`p-6` → Standard (DEFAULT)  \n`p-8` → Spacious/desktop\n\n**Margin hierarchy:**  \n`mb-4` → Between elements  \n`mb-6` → Between groups  \n`mb-8` → Between sections  \n`mb-12`+ → Between major blocks\n```\n\n### 3.5 Icon System\n\n```markdown\n## Icon System Guidelines\n\n### Icon Library\n\n**Recommended:** Lucide Icons (clean,

</template>\n</Card>\n```\n\n### Scoped Slots (Data Passing)\n\n```vue\n<!-- DataList.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\ninterface Props {\n  items: Array<any>\n}\n\nconst props = defineProps<Props>()\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div class=\"space-y-4\">\n    <div\n      v-for=\"(item, index) in items\"\n      :key=\"item.id\"\n    >\n      <slot :item=\"item\" :index=\"index\"

</template>\n</DataList>\n```\n\n### Fallback Content Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Alert.vue -->\n<template>\n  <div class=\"alert\">\n    <div v-if=\"$slots.icon\" class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <slot name=\"icon\" />\n    </div>\n    <div v-else class=\"alert-icon\">\n      <!-- Default icon -->\n      <AlertCircle class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n    </div>\n    \n    <div class=\"alert-content\">\n      <slot>\n        <!-- Fallback if no content provided -->\n        <p>No message provided</p>\n      </slot>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Conditional Slots Pattern\n\n```vue\n<!-- Modal.vue -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useSlots } from 'vue'\n\nconst slots = useSlots()\nconst hasActions = computed(() => !!slots.actions)\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div

When to Use Slots\n\n**Use slots when:**\n- ✅ Content structure varies significantly\n- ✅ Parent needs control over rendering\n- ✅ Building flexible, reusable components\n- ✅ Creating compound components (Card, Modal, Tabs)\n\n**Use props when:**\n- ✅ Data is simple (strings, numbers, booleans)\n- ✅ Component has fixed structure\n- ✅ Configuration over composition\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🛠️ Part

Animation Constants (src/constants/animations.ts)\n\n```typescript\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\n// Duration presets\nANIMATION_DURATION.INSTANT  // 100ms - Very quick state changes\nANIMATION_DURATION.FAST     // 200ms - Most common (buttons, hovers)\nANIMATION_DURATION.NORMAL   // 300ms - Modals, dropdowns\nANIMATION_DURATION.SLOW     // 500ms - Page transitions\n\n// Easing presets\nEASING.EASE_OUT    // Most common - elements settling\nEASING.SMOOTH      // Smooth transitions\nEASING.BOUNCE      // Playful effects\nEASING.ELASTIC     // Spring effects\n```\n\n#### 2. Web Animations API (useAnimateElement)\n\nFor complex, orchestrated animations:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\nconst element = ref<HTMLElement>()\nconst { animate } = useAnimateElement()\n\nconst handleClick = () => {\n  animate(element.value, 'fadeIn', {\n    duration: ANIMATION_DURATION.FAST,\n    easing: EASING.EASE_OUT\n  })\n}\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div ref=\"element\">Animated content</div>\n</template>\n```\n\n#### 3. Animation Presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n\nAvailable presets in `src/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimationPresets.ts`:\n\n- **slideUp** - Slide element up from bottom\n- **slideDown** - Slide element down from top\n- **fadeIn** - Fade in with opacity\n- **scaleUp** - Scale up from center\n- **scaleDown** - Scale down to center\n- **staggerFadeIn** - Sequential fade-in for lists\n- **popIn** - Playful pop-in effect\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useAnimationPresets } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimationPresets'\n\nconst { fadeInPreset, slideUpPreset } = useAnimationPresets()\n\n// Use preset directly\nelement.value?.animate(fadeInPreset.keyframes, fadeInPreset.options)\n</script>\n```\n\n#### 4. VueUse Motion (Already Installed)\n\nFor declarative component-level animations:\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useMotion } from '@vueuse/motion'\n\nconst target = ref()\n\nconst { variant } = useMotion(target, {\n  initial: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },\n  enter: { \n    opacity: 1, \n    y: 0,\n    transition: {\n      duration: 200,\n      ease: 'easeOut'\n    }\n  }\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div ref=\"target\">\n    Content with enter animation\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n#### 5. Tailwind Animation Utilities (NEW from Part 1)\n\nFor simple transitions and pre-built animations:\n\n```vue\n<!-- Transition utilities -->\n<div class=\"transition-fast ease-smooth\">\n  <!-- Fast transition with smooth easing -->\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"transition-medium ease-out\">\n  <!-- Medium speed transition -->\n</div>\n\n<!-- Pre-built animations -->\n<div class=\"animate-fade-in\">\n  <!-- Fade in animation -->\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"animate-slide-in-up\">\n  <!-- Slide in from bottom -->\n</div>\n\n<div class=\"animate-spin\">\n  <!-- Spinning loader -->\n</div>\n```\n\n### Animation Decision Tree\n\nChoose the right approach for your use case:\n\n**Simple transitions (hover, focus, state changes):**  \n→ Use Tailwind utilities: `transition-fast hover:scale-105`\n\n**Component enter/exit animations:**  \n→ Use VueUse Motion: `useMotion()` with initial/enter variants\n\n**Complex sequences or orchestrated animations:**  \n→ Use Web Animations API: `useAnimateElement()` with custom timing\n\n**Standard effects (fade, slide, scale):**  \n→ Use animation presets: `import { fadeInPreset } from '@/composables/useAnimationPresets'`\n\n**List/stagger animations:**  \n→ Use staggerFadeIn preset or VueUse Motion's stagger features\n\n### Common Animation Patterns (Socialaize)\n\n#### Vue Transition with Tailwind\n\n```vue\n<!-- Fade In/Out -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-fast ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-fast ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"show\">Content</div>\n</Transition>\n\n<!-- Slide Down (Dropdown) -->\n<Transition\n  enter-active-class=\"transition-medium ease-out\"\n  leave-active-class=\"transition-fast ease-in\"\n  enter-from-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n  leave-to-class=\"opacity-0 -translate-y-2\"\n>\n  <div v-if=\"isOpen\">Dropdown</div>\n</Transition>\n```\n\n#### Loading States\n\n```vue\n<!-- Spinning loader with Icon -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <Icon icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"w-6 h-6 animate-spin text-primary-600\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n#### Accordion with Smooth Height\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { ref } from 'vue'\nimport { useMotion } from '@vueuse/motion'\n\nconst isOpen = ref(false)\nconst content = ref()\n\nuseMotion(content, {\n  initial: { height: 0, opacity: 0 },\n  enter: { height: 'auto', opacity: 1 }\n})\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <button @click=\"isOpen = !isOpen\">Toggle</button>\n    <div v-if=\"isOpen\" ref=\"content\" class=\"overflow-hidden\">\n      <div class=\"p-4\">Accordion content</div>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n### Motion Preferences (Accessibility)\n\nAlways respect user preferences:\n\n```vue\n<!-- Global CSS (already in design-system.css) -->\n<style>\n@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {\n  *,\n  *::before,\n  *::after {\n    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;\n    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### Animation Checklist (Socialaize)\n\nWhen adding animations:\n- [ ] Used ANIMATION_DURATION constants (not hardcoded values)\n- [ ] Used EASING constants (not custom cubic-bezier)\n- [ ] Chose appropriate method (Tailwind vs VueUse vs Web Animations)\n- [ ] Duration is 100-300ms for most UI (not 500ms+)\n- [ ] Using performant properties (`opacity`, `transform`)\n- [ ] Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`\n- [ ] Doesn't animate on every render (use v-if/v-show properly)\n- [ ] Checked existing presets before creating custom animation\n```\n```\n\nThis completely replaces the generic animation section with Socialaize-specific guidance.\n\nReturn confirmation when complete.","content":[{"type":"text","text":"Perfect!

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n- Frontend: Vue 3 (Composition API), Astro (SSG)\n- State Management: Nanostore\n- Styling: Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties\n- UI Libraries: Shadcn-UI/Vue, Headless-UI/Vue, Floating-UI/Vue\n- Backend: Appwrite (databases, serverless functions)\n- Deployment: Cloudflare\n- Validation: Zod\n- Testing: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```","numLines":200,"startLine":1,"totalLines":3355}}}

Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### Enhanced MCP Configuration\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\n#### Full Configuration with Enhancements\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"firecrawl\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"firecrawl-mcp\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\": \"${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@playwright/mcp@latest\",\n        \"--save-trace\",\n        \"--save-video=1280x720\",\n        \"--save-session\",\n        \"--timeout-action=10000\",\n        \"--timeout-navigation=30000\",\n        \"--user-data-dir=./playwright-profile\",\n        \"--test-id-attribute=data-testid\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"tailwind-css\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"tailwindcss-mcp-server\"]\n    },\n    \"shadcn-vue\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"@jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server\",\n        \"--framework\",\n        \"vue\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"shadcn-vue-smithery\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\n        \"-y\",\n        \"mcp-remote\",\n        \"https://server.smithery.ai/@HelloGGX/shadcn-vue-mcp/mcp?api_key=b9979058-8139-4165-adeb-115311af41eb&profile=surprising-pike-0jJC8d\"\n      ]\n    },\n    \"astro-docs\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"astro-docs-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Playwright Enhancements Explained\n\n**New Arguments:**\n- `--save-trace`: Saves Playwright trace files for debugging\n- `--save-video=1280x720`: Records video of browser sessions\n- `--save-session`: Persists browser profile between sessions (no re-login!)\n- `--timeout-action=10000`: 10s timeout (good for Mac Pro hardware)\n- `--timeout-navigation=30000`: 30s page load timeout\n- `--user-data-dir=./playwright-profile`: Custom profile directory\n- `--test-id-attribute=data-testid`: Standard test ID attribute\n\n**Benefits:**\n- 🎥 Video recordings for failed tests\n- 📊 Trace files with full timeline debugging\n- 🔐 Persistent login (no authentication every test)\n- ⏱️ Appropriate timeouts for development machine\n- 🧪 Consistent test ID strategy\n\n**Astro Docs MCP:**\n- Provides up-to-date Astro documentation access\n- Helps with SSG/SSR decision-making\n- Better Vue + Astro integration patterns\n\n**Environment Variables:**\n\nCreate `.env` in project root:\n```bash\nFIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_key_here\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:**\n- `firecrawl` (web scraping)\n- `tailwind-css` (MCP)\n- `read`, `view`, `grep` (file operations)\n- `str_replace` (design-system.css updates)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0)**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search by type\nls src/components/vue/{ui,base,buttons,cards,modals}/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:**\n- `shadcn-vue` (both MCPs)\n- `tailwind-css` (MCP)\n- `create_file`, `str_replace`\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read`, `view` (file inspection)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3. Component Structure**\n- ✅ File in correct directory\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Base* prefix only for foundation components\n- ✅ Imports organized: vue → external → internal\n- ✅ Props, emits, models declared before logic\n\n**4. Accessibility (Built into Playwright)**\n```typescript\n// Auto-included in validation\nimport { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright';\n\ntest('accessibility', async ({ page }) => {\n  await injectAxe(page);\n  await checkA11y(page, null, {\n    detailedReport: true,\n    detailedReportOptions: { html: true }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Checks:**\n- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (text), ≥ 3:1 (UI)\n- Touch targets ≥ 44x44px\n- Keyboard navigation functional\n- ARIA attributes present\n- Semantic HTML structure\n\n**C. Smart Auto-Fix**\n\n**Auto-Fixable (Applied Automatically):**\n```typescript\ninterface AutoFix {\n  type: 'dark-mode' | 'spacing' | 'aria' | 'typescript';\n  fix: string;\n  confidence: 'high' | 'medium';\n}\n\n// Example fixes:\nconst autoFixes: AutoFix[] = [\n  {\n    type: 'dark-mode',\n    fix: 'Add dark:bg-gray-800 to complement bg-white',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'spacing',\n    fix: 'Replace margin: 23px with m-6 (24px from spacing scale)',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'aria',\n    fix: 'Add aria-label=\"Close modal\" to button with X icon',\n    confidence: 'medium'  // Will ask user to confirm\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'typescript',\n    fix: 'Add return type annotation to computed property',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**Blocking Issues (Requires Manual Fix):**\n```typescript\ninterface BlockingIssue {\n  severity: 'critical';\n  category: 'security' | 'ssr' | 'validation' | 'performance';\n  message: string;\n  location: string;\n}\n\n// Examples that block component approval:\nconst blockingIssues: BlockingIssue[] = [\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'ssr',\n    message: 'Using window object without isClient check',\n    location: 'Line 45: window.localStorage'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'security',\n    message: 'v-html without sanitization',\n    location: 'Line 67: v-html=\"userInput\"'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'validation',\n    message: 'Required prop missing validation',\n    location: 'Props: userId (no type narrowing)'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**D. Quality Scoring**\n```typescript\ninterface QualityReport {\n  score: number;              // 0-100\n  autoFixed: AutoFix[];\n  warnings: string[];         // Non-blocking issues\n  blocking: BlockingIssue[];  // Must fix to proceed\n  passed: boolean;            // score >= 90 && no blocking issues\n  screenshots: string[];      // Paths to generated images\n}\n```\n\n**Scoring Rules:**\n- TypeScript strictness: 25 points\n- Styling patterns: 20 points\n- Component structure: 15 points\n- Accessibility: 25 points\n- Design system compliance: 15 points\n\n**Thresholds:**\n- **100%:** Perfect, auto-approve\n- **90-99%:** Minor warnings, proceed with user acknowledgment\n- **<90% OR blocking issues:** Must fix before proceeding\n\n**E. Visual Regression Testing**\n\n**New Feature:** Automated screenshot comparison for detecting UI changes.\n\n```typescript\ninterface VisualRegressionResult {\n  component: string;\n  baseline: string;           // Path to baseline screenshot\n  current: string;            // Path to current screenshot\n  diff: string;               // Path to diff image\n  pixelDifference: number;    // Number of different pixels\n  diffPercentage: number;     // 0-100\n  passed: boolean;            // diffPercentage < threshold\n  threshold: number;          // Default: 0.1%\n}\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. First run: Capture baseline screenshots\n2. Subsequent runs: Compare against baseline\n3. Generate pixel diff image (red highlights)\n4. Flag differences > 0.1% for review\n5. User can accept (update baseline) or reject (investigate)\n\n**Storage:**\n```\ntests/visual-baselines/\n  ComponentName/\n    desktop-light.png\n    desktop-dark.png\n    mobile-light.png\n    [etc...]\n    \nscreenshots/\n  ComponentName/\n    2025-10-22-14-30/    # Timestamped runs\n      desktop-light.png\n      desktop-dark.png\n      diff-desktop-light.png  # If differences found\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. ui-documenter\n**Documentation generator (on-demand only)**\n\n**Role:** Generate concise component documentation\n\n**Tools:**\n- `create_file`\n- `view`, `read` (extract component interface)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A.

Forces architectural thinking before code.\n\n**Flow:**\n```\n1. Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB. Props Interface:\n```typescript\ninterface WizardProps {\n  steps: {\n    id: string;\n    label: string;\n    component?: Component;\n    validate?: () => Promise<boolean>;\n  }[];\n  currentStep?: number;\n  allowSkip?: boolean;\n  showProgress?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nC. Computed Classes Strategy:\n```typescript\nconst stepClasses = computed(() => (index: number) => [\n  'wizard-step',\n  index === currentStep.value && 'active',\n  index < currentStep.value && 'completed',\n  'transition-all duration-300'\n]);\n```\n\nD. Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1. Happy path: Complete all steps successfully\n2. Validation: Block progress if step invalid\n3. Navigation: Use all navigation methods\n4. Draft: Save and resume from middle step\n5. Keyboard: Complete wizard keyboard-only\n6. Mobile: Complete on mobile viewport\n7.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1. Visual-First Communication\n- ALWAYS provide ASCII mockups before code\n- Use visual comparisons when showing variants\n- Describe appearance first, implementation second\n- Highlight visual differences explicitly\n\n### 2. Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2.

Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0)**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search by type\nls src/components/vue/{ui,base,buttons,cards,modals}/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:**\n- `shadcn-vue` (both MCPs)\n- `tailwind-css` (MCP)\n- `create_file`, `str_replace`\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read`, `view` (file inspection)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3. Component Structure**\n- ✅ File in correct directory\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Base* prefix only for foundation components\n- ✅ Imports organized: vue → external → internal\n- ✅ Props, emits, models declared before logic\n\n**4. Accessibility (Built into Playwright)**\n```typescript\n// Auto-included in validation\nimport { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright';\n\ntest('accessibility', async ({ page }) => {\n  await injectAxe(page);\n  await checkA11y(page, null, {\n    detailedReport: true,\n    detailedReportOptions: { html: true }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Checks:**\n- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (text), ≥ 3:1 (UI)\n- Touch targets ≥ 44x44px\n- Keyboard navigation functional\n- ARIA attributes present\n- Semantic HTML structure\n\n**C.

Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB. Props Interface:\n```typescript\ninterface WizardProps {\n  steps: {\n    id: string;\n    label: string;\n    component?: Component;\n    validate?: () => Promise<boolean>;\n  }[];\n  currentStep?: number;\n  allowSkip?: boolean;\n  showProgress?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nC.

Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1. Visual-First Communication\n- ALWAYS provide ASCII mockups before code\n- Use visual comparisons when showing variants\n- Describe appearance first, implementation second\n- Highlight visual differences explicitly\n\n### 2. Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Optional MCPs\n\n**Playwright (Screenshot Automation)**\n- Purpose: Automated screenshot capture and visual regression testing\n- Alternative: Manual browser testing (recommended for start)\n- Setup: See ui-validator.md for configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**We do NOT use:**\n- ❌ firecrawl (not needed for our workflow)\n- ❌ tailwind-css MCP (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n- ❌ shadcn MCPs (we use Headless UI instead)\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:**\n- `firecrawl` (web scraping)\n- `tailwind-css` (MCP)\n- `read`, `view`, `grep` (file operations)\n- `str_replace` (design-system.css updates)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0)**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search by type\nls src/components/vue/{ui,base,buttons,cards,modals}/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:**\n- `shadcn-vue` (both MCPs)\n- `tailwind-css` (MCP)\n- `create_file`, `str_replace`\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read`, `view` (file inspection)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3.

Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB.

Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1.

Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Optional MCPs\n\n**Playwright (Screenshot Automation)**\n- Purpose: Automated screenshot capture and visual regression testing\n- Alternative: Manual browser testing (recommended for start)\n- Setup: See ui-validator.md for configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**We do NOT use:**\n- ❌ firecrawl (not needed for our workflow)\n- ❌ tailwind-css MCP (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n- ❌ shadcn MCPs (we use Headless UI instead)\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:** Core tools only (no MCPs required)\n- `read`, `grep`, `glob` (file operations and search)\n- `edit` (design-system.css updates)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:**\n- `shadcn-vue` (both MCPs)\n- `tailwind-css` (MCP)\n- `create_file`, `str_replace`\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read`, `view` (file inspection)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3. Component Structure**\n- ✅ File in correct directory\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Base* prefix only for foundation components\n- ✅ Imports organized: vue → external → internal\n- ✅ Props, emits, models declared before logic\n\n**4. Accessibility (Built into Playwright)**\n```typescript\n// Auto-included in validation\nimport { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright';\n\ntest('accessibility', async ({ page }) => {\n  await injectAxe(page);\n  await checkA11y(page, null, {\n    detailedReport: true,\n    detailedReportOptions: { html: true }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Checks:**\n- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (text), ≥ 3:1 (UI)\n- Touch targets ≥ 44x44px\n- Keyboard navigation functional\n- ARIA attributes present\n- Semantic HTML structure\n\n**C. Smart Auto-Fix**\n\n**Auto-Fixable (Applied Automatically):**\n```typescript\ninterface AutoFix {\n  type: 'dark-mode' | 'spacing' | 'aria' | 'typescript';\n  fix: string;\n  confidence: 'high' | 'medium';\n}\n\n// Example fixes:\nconst autoFixes: AutoFix[] = [\n  {\n    type: 'dark-mode',\n    fix: 'Add dark:bg-gray-800 to complement bg-white',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'spacing',\n    fix: 'Replace margin: 23px with m-6 (24px from spacing scale)',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'aria',\n    fix: 'Add aria-label=\"Close modal\" to button with X icon',\n    confidence: 'medium'  // Will ask user to confirm\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'typescript',\n    fix: 'Add return type annotation to computed property',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**Blocking Issues (Requires Manual Fix):**\n```typescript\ninterface BlockingIssue {\n  severity: 'critical';\n  category: 'security' | 'ssr' | 'validation' | 'performance';\n  message: string;\n  location: string;\n}\n\n// Examples that block component approval:\nconst blockingIssues: BlockingIssue[] = [\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'ssr',\n    message: 'Using window object without isClient check',\n    location: 'Line 45: window.localStorage'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'security',\n    message: 'v-html without sanitization',\n    location: 'Line 67: v-html=\"userInput\"'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'validation',\n    message: 'Required prop missing validation',\n    location: 'Props: userId (no type narrowing)'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**D. Quality Scoring**\n```typescript\ninterface QualityReport {\n  score: number;              // 0-100\n  autoFixed: AutoFix[];\n  warnings: string[];         // Non-blocking issues\n  blocking: BlockingIssue[];  // Must fix to proceed\n  passed: boolean;            // score >= 90 && no blocking issues\n  screenshots: string[];      // Paths to generated images\n}\n```\n\n**Scoring Rules:**\n- TypeScript strictness: 25 points\n- Styling patterns: 20 points\n- Component structure: 15 points\n- Accessibility: 25 points\n- Design system compliance: 15 points\n\n**Thresholds:**\n- **100%:** Perfect, auto-approve\n- **90-99%:** Minor warnings, proceed with user acknowledgment\n- **<90% OR blocking issues:** Must fix before proceeding\n\n**E. Visual Regression Testing**\n\n**New Feature:** Automated screenshot comparison for detecting UI changes.\n\n```typescript\ninterface VisualRegressionResult {\n  component: string;\n  baseline: string;           // Path to baseline screenshot\n  current: string;            // Path to current screenshot\n  diff: string;               // Path to diff image\n  pixelDifference: number;    // Number of different pixels\n  diffPercentage: number;     // 0-100\n  passed: boolean;            // diffPercentage < threshold\n  threshold: number;          // Default: 0.1%\n}\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. First run: Capture baseline screenshots\n2. Subsequent runs: Compare against baseline\n3. Generate pixel diff image (red highlights)\n4. Flag differences > 0.1% for review\n5. User can accept (update baseline) or reject (investigate)\n\n**Storage:**\n```\ntests/visual-baselines/\n  ComponentName/\n    desktop-light.png\n    desktop-dark.png\n    mobile-light.png\n    [etc...]\n    \nscreenshots/\n  ComponentName/\n    2025-10-22-14-30/    # Timestamped runs\n      desktop-light.png\n      desktop-dark.png\n      diff-desktop-light.png  # If differences found\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. ui-documenter\n**Documentation generator (on-demand only)**\n\n**Role:** Generate concise component documentation\n\n**Tools:**\n- `create_file`\n- `view`, `read` (extract component interface)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A.

Forces architectural thinking before code.\n\n**Flow:**\n```\n1. Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB. Props Interface:\n```typescript\ninterface WizardProps {\n  steps: {\n    id: string;\n    label: string;\n    component?: Component;\n    validate?: () => Promise<boolean>;\n  }[];\n  currentStep?: number;\n  allowSkip?: boolean;\n  showProgress?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nC. Computed Classes Strategy:\n```typescript\nconst stepClasses = computed(() => (index: number) => [\n  'wizard-step',\n  index === currentStep.value && 'active',\n  index < currentStep.value && 'completed',\n  'transition-all duration-300'\n]);\n```\n\nD. Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5.

Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1. Visual-First Communication\n- ALWAYS provide ASCII mockups before code\n- Use visual comparisons when showing variants\n- Describe appearance first, implementation second\n- Highlight visual differences explicitly\n\n### 2. Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Optional MCPs\n\n**Playwright (Screenshot Automation)**\n- Purpose: Automated screenshot capture and visual regression testing\n- Alternative: Manual browser testing (recommended for start)\n- Setup: See ui-validator.md for configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**We do NOT use:**\n- ❌ firecrawl (not needed for our workflow)\n- ❌ tailwind-css MCP (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n- ❌ shadcn MCPs (we use Headless UI instead)\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:** Core tools only (no MCPs required)\n- `read`, `grep`, `glob` (file operations and search)\n- `edit` (design-system.css updates)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:** Core tools for component creation\n- `write`, `edit` (component creation and modification)\n- Reference: Socialaize component templates (see below)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read`, `view` (file inspection)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3. Component Structure**\n- ✅ File in correct directory\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Base* prefix only for foundation components\n- ✅ Imports organized: vue → external → internal\n- ✅ Props, emits, models declared before logic\n\n**4. Accessibility (Built into Playwright)**\n```typescript\n// Auto-included in validation\nimport { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright';\n\ntest('accessibility', async ({ page }) => {\n  await injectAxe(page);\n  await checkA11y(page, null, {\n    detailedReport: true,\n    detailedReportOptions: { html: true }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Checks:**\n- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (text), ≥ 3:1 (UI)\n- Touch targets ≥ 44x44px\n- Keyboard navigation functional\n- ARIA attributes present\n- Semantic HTML structure\n\n**C. Smart Auto-Fix**\n\n**Auto-Fixable (Applied Automatically):**\n```typescript\ninterface AutoFix {\n  type: 'dark-mode' | 'spacing' | 'aria' | 'typescript';\n  fix: string;\n  confidence: 'high' | 'medium';\n}\n\n// Example fixes:\nconst autoFixes: AutoFix[] = [\n  {\n    type: 'dark-mode',\n    fix: 'Add dark:bg-gray-800 to complement bg-white',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'spacing',\n    fix: 'Replace margin: 23px with m-6 (24px from spacing scale)',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'aria',\n    fix: 'Add aria-label=\"Close modal\" to button with X icon',\n    confidence: 'medium'  // Will ask user to confirm\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'typescript',\n    fix: 'Add return type annotation to computed property',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**Blocking Issues (Requires Manual Fix):**\n```typescript\ninterface BlockingIssue {\n  severity: 'critical';\n  category: 'security' | 'ssr' | 'validation' | 'performance';\n  message: string;\n  location: string;\n}\n\n// Examples that block component approval:\nconst blockingIssues: BlockingIssue[] = [\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'ssr',\n    message: 'Using window object without isClient check',\n    location: 'Line 45: window.localStorage'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'security',\n    message: 'v-html without sanitization',\n    location: 'Line 67: v-html=\"userInput\"'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'validation',\n    message: 'Required prop missing validation',\n    location: 'Props: userId (no type narrowing)'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**D. Quality Scoring**\n```typescript\ninterface QualityReport {\n  score: number;              // 0-100\n  autoFixed: AutoFix[];\n  warnings: string[];         // Non-blocking issues\n  blocking: BlockingIssue[];  // Must fix to proceed\n  passed: boolean;            // score >= 90 && no blocking issues\n  screenshots: string[];      // Paths to generated images\n}\n```\n\n**Scoring Rules:**\n- TypeScript strictness: 25 points\n- Styling patterns: 20 points\n- Component structure: 15 points\n- Accessibility: 25 points\n- Design system compliance: 15 points\n\n**Thresholds:**\n- **100%:** Perfect, auto-approve\n- **90-99%:** Minor warnings, proceed with user acknowledgment\n- **<90% OR blocking issues:** Must fix before proceeding\n\n**E. Visual Regression Testing**\n\n**New Feature:** Automated screenshot comparison for detecting UI changes.\n\n```typescript\ninterface VisualRegressionResult {\n  component: string;\n  baseline: string;           // Path to baseline screenshot\n  current: string;            // Path to current screenshot\n  diff: string;               // Path to diff image\n  pixelDifference: number;    // Number of different pixels\n  diffPercentage: number;     // 0-100\n  passed: boolean;            // diffPercentage < threshold\n  threshold: number;          // Default: 0.1%\n}\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. First run: Capture baseline screenshots\n2. Subsequent runs: Compare against baseline\n3. Generate pixel diff image (red highlights)\n4. Flag differences > 0.1% for review\n5. User can accept (update baseline) or reject (investigate)\n\n**Storage:**\n```\ntests/visual-baselines/\n  ComponentName/\n    desktop-light.png\n    desktop-dark.png\n    mobile-light.png\n    [etc...]\n    \nscreenshots/\n  ComponentName/\n    2025-10-22-14-30/    # Timestamped runs\n      desktop-light.png\n      desktop-dark.png\n      diff-desktop-light.png  # If differences found\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. ui-documenter\n**Documentation generator (on-demand only)**\n\n**Role:** Generate concise component documentation\n\n**Tools:**\n- `create_file`\n- `view`, `read` (extract component interface)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A.

Auto-Extract Component Interface**\n```typescript\n// Parse component file to extract:\ninterface ComponentInterface {\n  name: string;\n  props: PropDefinition[];\n  emits: EmitDefinition[];\n  slots: SlotDefinition[];\n  models: ModelDefinition[];\n}\n\n// Then generate markdown table from interface\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Custom Commands\n\n### Planning & Strategy\n\n#### `/ui-plan [description]`\n**NEW:** Strategic planning before component creation\n\n**Purpose:** Reduce bugs by 30% through detailed upfront planning. Forces architectural thinking before code.\n\n**Flow:**\n```\n1. Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB. Props Interface:\n```typescript\ninterface WizardProps {\n  steps: {\n    id: string;\n    label: string;\n    component?: Component;\n    validate?: () => Promise<boolean>;\n  }[];\n  currentStep?: number;\n  allowSkip?: boolean;\n  showProgress?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nC. Computed Classes Strategy:\n```typescript\nconst stepClasses = computed(() => (index: number) => [\n  'wizard-step',\n  index === currentStep.value && 'active',\n  index < currentStep.value && 'completed',\n  'transition-all duration-300'\n]);\n```\n\nD. Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1. Visual-First Communication\n- ALWAYS provide ASCII mockups before code\n- Use visual comparisons when showing variants\n- Describe appearance first, implementation second\n- Highlight visual differences explicitly\n\n### 2. Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Optional MCPs\n\n**Playwright (Screenshot Automation)**\n- Purpose: Automated screenshot capture and visual regression testing\n- Alternative: Manual browser testing (recommended for start)\n- Setup: See ui-validator.md for configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**We do NOT use:**\n- ❌ firecrawl (not needed for our workflow)\n- ❌ tailwind-css MCP (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n- ❌ shadcn MCPs (we use Headless UI instead)\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:** Core tools only (no MCPs required)\n- `read`, `grep`, `glob` (file operations and search)\n- `edit` (design-system.css updates)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:** Core tools for component creation\n- `write`, `edit` (component creation and modification)\n- Reference: Socialaize component templates (see below)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**Socialaize Component Template:**\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read`, `view` (file inspection)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3.

Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB.

Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1.

Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Optional MCPs\n\n**Playwright (Screenshot Automation)**\n- Purpose: Automated screenshot capture and visual regression testing\n- Alternative: Manual browser testing (recommended for start)\n- Setup: See ui-validator.md for configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**We do NOT use:**\n- ❌ firecrawl (not needed for our workflow)\n- ❌ tailwind-css MCP (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n- ❌ shadcn MCPs (we use Headless UI instead)\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:** Core tools only (no MCPs required)\n- `read`, `grep`, `glob` (file operations and search)\n- `edit` (design-system.css updates)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:** Core tools for component creation\n- `write`, `edit` (component creation and modification)\n- Reference: Socialaize component templates (see below)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**Socialaize Component Template:**\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP - OPTIONAL, see note below)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read` (file inspection)\n\n**Note on Playwright:**\nPlaywright MCP is **OPTIONAL**. For manual testing:\n1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`\n2. Navigate to component test page\n3. Toggle dark mode: `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')`\n4. Test responsive: Browser DevTools\n5. Take screenshots manually if needed\n\nIf you want automated screenshots, add Playwright MCP (see MCP Configuration section above).\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3. Component Structure**\n- ✅ File in correct directory\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Base* prefix only for foundation components\n- ✅ Imports organized: vue → external → internal\n- ✅ Props, emits, models declared before logic\n\n**4. Accessibility (Built into Playwright)**\n```typescript\n// Auto-included in validation\nimport { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright';\n\ntest('accessibility', async ({ page }) => {\n  await injectAxe(page);\n  await checkA11y(page, null, {\n    detailedReport: true,\n    detailedReportOptions: { html: true }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Checks:**\n- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (text), ≥ 3:1 (UI)\n- Touch targets ≥ 44x44px\n- Keyboard navigation functional\n- ARIA attributes present\n- Semantic HTML structure\n\n**C. Smart Auto-Fix**\n\n**Auto-Fixable (Applied Automatically):**\n```typescript\ninterface AutoFix {\n  type: 'dark-mode' | 'spacing' | 'aria' | 'typescript';\n  fix: string;\n  confidence: 'high' | 'medium';\n}\n\n// Example fixes:\nconst autoFixes: AutoFix[] = [\n  {\n    type: 'dark-mode',\n    fix: 'Add dark:bg-gray-800 to complement bg-white',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'spacing',\n    fix: 'Replace margin: 23px with m-6 (24px from spacing scale)',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'aria',\n    fix: 'Add aria-label=\"Close modal\" to button with X icon',\n    confidence: 'medium'  // Will ask user to confirm\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'typescript',\n    fix: 'Add return type annotation to computed property',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**Blocking Issues (Requires Manual Fix):**\n```typescript\ninterface BlockingIssue {\n  severity: 'critical';\n  category: 'security' | 'ssr' | 'validation' | 'performance';\n  message: string;\n  location: string;\n}\n\n// Examples that block component approval:\nconst blockingIssues: BlockingIssue[] = [\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'ssr',\n    message: 'Using window object without isClient check',\n    location: 'Line 45: window.localStorage'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'security',\n    message: 'v-html without sanitization',\n    location: 'Line 67: v-html=\"userInput\"'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'validation',\n    message: 'Required prop missing validation',\n    location: 'Props: userId (no type narrowing)'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**D. Quality Scoring**\n```typescript\ninterface QualityReport {\n  score: number;              // 0-100\n  autoFixed: AutoFix[];\n  warnings: string[];         // Non-blocking issues\n  blocking: BlockingIssue[];  // Must fix to proceed\n  passed: boolean;            // score >= 90 && no blocking issues\n  screenshots: string[];      // Paths to generated images\n}\n```\n\n**Scoring Rules:**\n- TypeScript strictness: 25 points\n- Styling patterns: 20 points\n- Component structure: 15 points\n- Accessibility: 25 points\n- Design system compliance: 15 points\n\n**Thresholds:**\n- **100%:** Perfect, auto-approve\n- **90-99%:** Minor warnings, proceed with user acknowledgment\n- **<90% OR blocking issues:** Must fix before proceeding\n\n**E. Visual Regression Testing**\n\n**New Feature:** Automated screenshot comparison for detecting UI changes.\n\n```typescript\ninterface VisualRegressionResult {\n  component: string;\n  baseline: string;           // Path to baseline screenshot\n  current: string;            // Path to current screenshot\n  diff: string;               // Path to diff image\n  pixelDifference: number;    // Number of different pixels\n  diffPercentage: number;     // 0-100\n  passed: boolean;            // diffPercentage < threshold\n  threshold: number;          // Default: 0.1%\n}\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. First run: Capture baseline screenshots\n2. Subsequent runs: Compare against baseline\n3. Generate pixel diff image (red highlights)\n4. Flag differences > 0.1% for review\n5. User can accept (update baseline) or reject (investigate)\n\n**Storage:**\n```\ntests/visual-baselines/\n  ComponentName/\n    desktop-light.png\n    desktop-dark.png\n    mobile-light.png\n    [etc...]\n    \nscreenshots/\n  ComponentName/\n    2025-10-22-14-30/    # Timestamped runs\n      desktop-light.png\n      desktop-dark.png\n      diff-desktop-light.png  # If differences found\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. ui-documenter\n**Documentation generator (on-demand only)**\n\n**Role:** Generate concise component documentation\n\n**Tools:**\n- `create_file`\n- `view`, `read` (extract component interface)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A.

ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB. Props Interface:\n```typescript\ninterface WizardProps {\n  steps: {\n    id: string;\n    label: string;\n    component?: Component;\n    validate?: () => Promise<boolean>;\n  }[];\n  currentStep?: number;\n  allowSkip?: boolean;\n  showProgress?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nC. Computed Classes Strategy:\n```typescript\nconst stepClasses = computed(() => (index: number) => [\n  'wizard-step',\n  index === currentStep.value && 'active',\n  index < currentStep.value && 'completed',\n  'transition-all duration-300'\n]);\n```\n\nD. Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1. Happy path: Complete all steps successfully\n2. Validation: Block progress if step invalid\n3. Navigation: Use all navigation methods\n4. Draft: Save and resume from middle step\n5. Keyboard: Complete wizard keyboard-only\n6. Mobile: Complete on mobile viewport\n7. Accessibility: Pass screen reader test\n\nSTEP 6: Estimated Complexity\n─────────────────────────────\nTime: ~20 minutes\nLines of code: ~200\nDependencies: @vueuse/core (for focus trap)\nRisk: Low (mostly composition)\n\n───────────────────────────────────────\n\nREVIEW THIS PLAN:\n\nDoes this approach make sense?\nAny concerns or changes needed?\nShould we use a different composition strategy?\n\nReply with:\n  • \"Approved\" → I'll start implementation\n  • \"Change X\" → I'll revise the plan\n  • \"Show alternative\" → I'll present another approach\n```\n\n**Key Features:**\n- ❌ NO code written during planning\n- ✅ Forces systematic thinking\n- ✅ Identifies reusable components early\n- ✅ Exposes potential issues upfront\n- ✅ User reviews architecture before investment\n- ✅ Clear go/no-go decision point\n\n---\n\n### Core Commands\n\n#### `/ui-create [description]`\n**Full component creation pipeline**\n\n**Flow:**\n```\n1. ui-analyzer: Search existing components (Step 0)\n   → Show similar components\n   → Ask: \"Extend BaseButton or create new?\"\n\n2. ui-analyzer: Design analysis\n   → Extract tokens\n   → Pattern matching\n   → A11y pre-check\n\n3. ui-builder: Generate 3 variants\n   → Present with ASCII mockups\n   → User picks best\n\n4. ui-builder: Implement chosen variant\n   → Create test page (/src/pages/test/ComponentName.astro)\n   → Wait for user approval\n\n5.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1. Visual-First Communication\n- ALWAYS provide ASCII mockups before code\n- Use visual comparisons when showing variants\n- Describe appearance first, implementation second\n- Highlight visual differences explicitly\n\n### 2. Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Optional MCPs\n\n**Playwright (Screenshot Automation)**\n- Purpose: Automated screenshot capture and visual regression testing\n- Alternative: Manual browser testing (recommended for start)\n- Setup: See ui-validator.md for configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**We do NOT use:**\n- ❌ firecrawl (not needed for our workflow)\n- ❌ tailwind-css MCP (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n- ❌ shadcn MCPs (we use Headless UI instead)\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:** Core tools only (no MCPs required)\n- `read`, `grep`, `glob` (file operations and search)\n- `edit` (design-system.css updates)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:** Core tools for component creation\n- `write`, `edit` (component creation and modification)\n- Reference: Socialaize component templates (see below)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**Socialaize Component Template:**\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP - OPTIONAL, see note below)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read` (file inspection)\n\n**Note on Playwright:**\nPlaywright MCP is **OPTIONAL**. For manual testing:\n1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`\n2. Navigate to component test page\n3. Toggle dark mode: `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')`\n4. Test responsive: Browser DevTools\n5. Take screenshots manually if needed\n\nIf you want automated screenshots, add Playwright MCP (see MCP Configuration section above).\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3.

Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB.

Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1.

Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n# Verify Node.js 18+\nnode --version\n\n# Install Playwright browsers\nnpx playwright install chromium\n\n# Verify Prettier installed\nnpm list prettier\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Create CLAUDE.md\n\n**CRITICAL FIRST STEP:** Create `/CLAUDE.md` in your project root.\n\nSee the [CLAUDE.md Setup](#claudemd-setup) section above for comprehensive guidance on what to include.\n\n**Quick Start Template:**\n\n```markdown\n# Socialaize Project Guide for Claude\n\n## Quick Commands\nnpm run dev       # Start dev\nnpm run test      # Run tests\nnpm run lint      # Lint code\n\n## Code Rules\n✅ Always: <script setup lang=\"ts\">, type-only props, Tailwind classes\n❌ Never: Runtime props, @apply, inline styles, hardcoded colors\n\n## Architecture\n[Your project structure]\n\n## Workflow\n1. Search existing components first\n2. Use provider pattern for platforms\n3. Compose before creating\n4. Run lint before commit\n\n[Add your specific project details]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Configure Permissions\n\nCreate `.claude/permissions.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\"ls\", \"cat\", \"grep\", \"git status\", \"git diff\"],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\"rm\", \"git commit\", \"npm install\"],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\"src/components/vue/\", \"src/styles/\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\nMCPs are **optional**. All core functionality works without them.\n\nIf you want automated screenshot testing, create `.mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**No environment variables needed** - core workflow uses built-in tools only.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Directory Structure\n\n```bash\n# Create required directories\nmkdir -p .claude/agents\nmkdir -p .claude/commands\nmkdir -p .claude/output-styles\nmkdir -p .claude/hooks\nmkdir -p screenshots\nmkdir -p tests/visual-baselines\nmkdir -p docs/components\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Subagent Files\n\n**Create 4 files in `.claude/agents/`:**\n\n1. `ui-analyzer.md` - Design analysis + token management\n2. `ui-builder.md` - Component generation\n3. `ui-validator.md` - Visual testing + quality checks\n4. `ui-documenter.md` - Documentation generation\n\n*Detailed agent definitions available in separate implementation guide.*\n\n---\n\n### 7. Command Files\n\n**Create files in `.claude/commands/`:**\n\n1. `ui-plan.md` - Strategic planning\n2. `ui-create.md` - Full creation pipeline\n3. `ui-variants.md` - Variant generation\n4. `ui-review.md` - Component analysis\n5. `ui-compose.md` - Component composition\n6. `ui-batch-update.md` - Bulk operations\n7. `ui-screenshot.md` - Quick screenshots\n8. `ui-visual-regression.md` - Visual diff testing\n9. `ui-validate-tokens.md` - Token compliance\n10. `ui-provider-refactor.md` - Provider pattern refactor\n11. `ui-document.md` - Documentation generation\n\n*Detailed command definitions available in separate implementation guide.*\n\n---\n\n### 8. Output Style\n\n**Create:** `~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md`\n\nCopy the implementation from the [Output Style section](#output-style-ui-designer) above.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Test the System\n\n```bash\n# Start Claude Code\nclaude\n\n# Activate ui-designer mode\n/output-style ui-designer\n\n# Test planning workflow\n/ui-plan Badge with status colors\n\n# Test component creation\n/ui-create Badge with status colors\n\n# Test variant generation\n/ui-variants 3 Card for displaying posts\n\n# Test composition\n/ui-compose BaseModal + TextInput\n\n# Test review\n/ui-review src/components/vue/buttons/PrimaryButton.vue\n\n# Test visual regression\n/ui-visual-regression src/components/vue/buttons/PrimaryButton.vue\n\n# Test token validation\n/ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Quality Metrics\n\n### Track System Effectiveness\n\n**File:** `.claude/metrics.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"components\": {\n    \"created\": 0,\n    \"reviewed\": 0,\n    \"composed\": 0,\n    \"refactored\": 0,\n    \"planned\": 0\n  },\n  \"quality\": {\n    \"avgScore\": 0,\n    \"autoFixed\": 0,\n    \"manualFixes\": 0\n  },\n  \"accessibility\": {\n    \"issuesFound\": 0,\n    \"issuesFixed\": 0,\n    \"compliance\": 0\n  },\n  \"efficiency\": {\n    \"avgTimePerComponent\": 0,\n    \"variantsGenerated\": 0,\n    \"iterationsPerComponent\": 0,\n    \"planningTimeAvg\": 0\n  },\n  \"codeReduction\": {\n    \"providerDuplication\": 57,\n    \"linesRemoved\": 0,\n    \"targetReduction\": 3050\n  },\n  \"visualRegression\": {\n    \"testsRun\": 0,\n    \"changesDetected\": 0,\n    \"baselineUpdates\": 0\n  },\n  \"tokenCompliance\": {\n    \"avgScore\": 0,\n    \"violationsFixed\": 0,\n    \"auditsRun\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Targets\n\n**Quality:**\n- Average quality score: ≥95%\n- A11y compliance: 100%\n- Design system compliance: 100%\n- Token compliance: ≥95%\n\n**Speed:**\n- Average time per component: ≤10 minutes\n- Planning time: 2-3 minutes\n- Refinement iterations: 2-3 rounds\n- Visual regression test: <30 seconds\n\n**Code Health:**\n- Provider duplication: 0%\n- Code reduction: ≥70%\n- Test coverage: ≥90%\n- Visual regression pass rate: ≥98%\n\n**Workflow Efficiency:**\n- Components using composition: ≥80%\n- Components needing refinement: ≤30%\n- Blocking issues rate: ≤5%\n- Auto-fix success rate: ≥90%\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What's New in v3\n\n### Major Enhancements\n\n**1.

Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**","numLines":100,"startLine":380,"totalLines":3376}}}

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3.

Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Optional MCPs\n\n**Playwright (Screenshot Automation)**\n- Purpose: Automated screenshot capture and visual regression testing\n- Alternative: Manual browser testing (recommended for start)\n- Setup: See ui-validator.md for configuration\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**We do NOT use:**\n- ❌ firecrawl (not needed for our workflow)\n- ❌ tailwind-css MCP (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n- ❌ shadcn MCPs (we use Headless UI instead)\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:** Core tools only (no MCPs required)\n- `read`, `grep`, `glob` (file operations and search)\n- `edit` (design-system.css updates)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:** Core tools for component creation\n- `write`, `edit` (component creation and modification)\n- Reference: Socialaize component templates (see below)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**Socialaize Component Template:**\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP - OPTIONAL, see note below)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read` (file inspection)\n\n**Note on Playwright:**\nPlaywright MCP is **OPTIONAL**. For manual testing:\n1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`\n2. Navigate to component test page\n3. Toggle dark mode: `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')`\n4. Test responsive: Browser DevTools\n5. Take screenshots manually if needed\n\nIf you want automated screenshots, add Playwright MCP (see MCP Configuration section above).\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3. Component Structure**\n- ✅ File in correct directory\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Base* prefix only for foundation components\n- ✅ Imports organized: vue → external → internal\n- ✅ Props, emits, models declared before logic\n\n**4. Accessibility (Built into Playwright)**\n```typescript\n// Auto-included in validation\nimport { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright';\n\ntest('accessibility', async ({ page }) => {\n  await injectAxe(page);\n  await checkA11y(page, null, {\n    detailedReport: true,\n    detailedReportOptions: { html: true }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Checks:**\n- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (text), ≥ 3:1 (UI)\n- Touch targets ≥ 44x44px\n- Keyboard navigation functional\n- ARIA attributes present\n- Semantic HTML structure\n\n**C. Smart Auto-Fix**\n\n**Auto-Fixable (Applied Automatically):**\n```typescript\ninterface AutoFix {\n  type: 'dark-mode' | 'spacing' | 'aria' | 'typescript';\n  fix: string;\n  confidence: 'high' | 'medium';\n}\n\n// Example fixes:\nconst autoFixes: AutoFix[] = [\n  {\n    type: 'dark-mode',\n    fix: 'Add dark:bg-gray-800 to complement bg-white',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'spacing',\n    fix: 'Replace margin: 23px with m-6 (24px from spacing scale)',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'aria',\n    fix: 'Add aria-label=\"Close modal\" to button with X icon',\n    confidence: 'medium'  // Will ask user to confirm\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'typescript',\n    fix: 'Add return type annotation to computed property',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**Blocking Issues (Requires Manual Fix):**\n```typescript\ninterface BlockingIssue {\n  severity: 'critical';\n  category: 'security' | 'ssr' | 'validation' | 'performance';\n  message: string;\n  location: string;\n}\n\n// Examples that block component approval:\nconst blockingIssues: BlockingIssue[] = [\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'ssr',\n    message: 'Using window object without isClient check',\n    location: 'Line 45: window.localStorage'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'security',\n    message: 'v-html without sanitization',\n    location: 'Line 67: v-html=\"userInput\"'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'validation',\n    message: 'Required prop missing validation',\n    location: 'Props: userId (no type narrowing)'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**D. Quality Scoring**\n```typescript\ninterface QualityReport {\n  score: number;              // 0-100\n  autoFixed: AutoFix[];\n  warnings: string[];         // Non-blocking issues\n  blocking: BlockingIssue[];  // Must fix to proceed\n  passed: boolean;            // score >= 90 && no blocking issues\n  screenshots: string[];      // Paths to generated images\n}\n```\n\n**Scoring Rules:**\n- TypeScript strictness: 25 points\n- Styling patterns: 20 points\n- Component structure: 15 points\n- Accessibility: 25 points\n- Design system compliance: 15 points\n\n**Thresholds:**\n- **100%:** Perfect, auto-approve\n- **90-99%:** Minor warnings, proceed with user acknowledgment\n- **<90% OR blocking issues:** Must fix before proceeding\n\n**E. Visual Regression Testing**\n\n**New Feature:** Automated screenshot comparison for detecting UI changes.\n\n```typescript\ninterface VisualRegressionResult {\n  component: string;\n  baseline: string;           // Path to baseline screenshot\n  current: string;            // Path to current screenshot\n  diff: string;               // Path to diff image\n  pixelDifference: number;    // Number of different pixels\n  diffPercentage: number;     // 0-100\n  passed: boolean;            // diffPercentage < threshold\n  threshold: number;          // Default: 0.1%\n}\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n1.

Forces architectural thinking before code.\n\n**Flow:**\n```\n1. Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB. Props Interface:\n```typescript\ninterface WizardProps {\n  steps: {\n    id: string;\n    label: string;\n    component?: Component;\n    validate?: () => Promise<boolean>;\n  }[];\n  currentStep?: number;\n  allowSkip?: boolean;\n  showProgress?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nC. Computed Classes Strategy:\n```typescript\nconst stepClasses = computed(() => (index: number) => [\n  'wizard-step',\n  index === currentStep.value && 'active',\n  index < currentStep.value && 'completed',\n  'transition-all duration-300'\n]);\n```\n\nD. Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1. Happy path: Complete all steps successfully\n2. Validation: Block progress if step invalid\n3. Navigation: Use all navigation methods\n4. Draft: Save and resume from middle step\n5.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1. Visual-First Communication\n- ALWAYS provide ASCII mockups before code\n- Use visual comparisons when showing variants\n- Describe appearance first, implementation second\n- Highlight visual differences explicitly\n\n### 2. Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1.

Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n# Verify Node.js 18+\nnode --version\n\n# Install Playwright browsers\nnpx playwright install chromium\n\n# Verify Prettier installed\nnpm list prettier\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Create CLAUDE.md\n\n**CRITICAL FIRST STEP:** Create `/CLAUDE.md` in your project root.\n\nSee the [CLAUDE.md Setup](#claudemd-setup) section above for comprehensive guidance on what to include.\n\n**Quick Start Template:**\n\n```markdown\n# Socialaize Project Guide for Claude\n\n## Quick Commands\nnpm run dev       # Start dev\nnpm run test      # Run tests\nnpm run lint      # Lint code\n\n## Code Rules\n✅ Always: <script setup lang=\"ts\">, type-only props, Tailwind classes\n❌ Never: Runtime props, @apply, inline styles, hardcoded colors\n\n## Architecture\n[Your project structure]\n\n## Workflow\n1. Search existing components first\n2. Use provider pattern for platforms\n3. Compose before creating\n4. Run lint before commit\n\n[Add your specific project details]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Configure Permissions\n\nCreate `.claude/permissions.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\"ls\", \"cat\", \"grep\", \"git status\", \"git diff\"],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\"rm\", \"git commit\", \"npm install\"],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\"src/components/vue/\", \"src/styles/\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\nMCPs are **optional**. All core functionality works without them.\n\nIf you want automated screenshot testing, create `.mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**No environment variables needed** - core workflow uses built-in tools only.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Directory Structure\n\n```bash\n# Create required directories\nmkdir -p .claude/agents\nmkdir -p .claude/commands\nmkdir -p .claude/output-styles\nmkdir -p .claude/hooks\nmkdir -p screenshots\nmkdir -p tests/visual-baselines\nmkdir -p docs/components\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Subagent Files\n\n**Create 4 files in `.claude/agents/`:**\n\n1. `ui-analyzer.md` - Design analysis + token management\n2. `ui-builder.md` - Component generation\n3. `ui-validator.md` - Visual testing + quality checks\n4. `ui-documenter.md` - Documentation generation\n\n*Detailed agent definitions available in separate implementation guide.*\n\n---\n\n### 7. Command Files\n\n**Create files in `.claude/commands/`:**\n\n1. `ui-plan.md` - Strategic planning\n2. `ui-create.md` - Full creation pipeline\n3. `ui-variants.md` - Variant generation\n4. `ui-review.md` - Component analysis\n5. `ui-compose.md` - Component composition\n6. `ui-batch-update.md` - Bulk operations\n7. `ui-screenshot.md` - Quick screenshots\n8. `ui-visual-regression.md` - Visual diff testing\n9. `ui-validate-tokens.md` - Token compliance\n10. `ui-provider-refactor.md` - Provider pattern refactor\n11. `ui-document.md` - Documentation generation\n\n*Detailed command definitions available in separate implementation guide.*\n\n---\n\n### 8. Output Style\n\n**Create:** `~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md`\n\nCopy the implementation from the [Output Style section](#output-style-ui-designer) above.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Test the System\n\n```bash\n# Start Claude Code\nclaude\n\n# Activate ui-designer mode\n/output-style ui-designer\n\n# Test planning workflow\n/ui-plan Badge with status colors\n\n# Test component creation\n/ui-create Badge with status colors\n\n# Test variant generation\n/ui-variants 3 Card for displaying posts\n\n# Test composition\n/ui-compose BaseModal + TextInput\n\n# Test review\n/ui-review src/components/vue/buttons/PrimaryButton.vue\n\n# Test visual regression\n/ui-visual-regression src/components/vue/buttons/PrimaryButton.vue\n\n# Test token validation\n/ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Quality Metrics\n\n### Track System Effectiveness\n\n**File:** `.claude/metrics.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"components\": {\n    \"created\": 0,\n    \"reviewed\": 0,\n    \"composed\": 0,\n    \"refactored\": 0,\n    \"planned\": 0\n  },\n  \"quality\": {\n    \"avgScore\": 0,\n    \"autoFixed\": 0,\n    \"manualFixes\": 0\n  },\n  \"accessibility\": {\n    \"issuesFound\": 0,\n    \"issuesFixed\": 0,\n    \"compliance\": 0\n  },\n  \"efficiency\": {\n    \"avgTimePerComponent\": 0,\n    \"variantsGenerated\": 0,\n    \"iterationsPerComponent\": 0,\n    \"planningTimeAvg\": 0\n  },\n  \"codeReduction\": {\n    \"providerDuplication\": 57,\n    \"linesRemoved\": 0,\n    \"targetReduction\": 3050\n  },\n  \"visualRegression\": {\n    \"testsRun\": 0,\n    \"changesDetected\": 0,\n    \"baselineUpdates\": 0\n  },\n  \"tokenCompliance\": {\n    \"avgScore\": 0,\n    \"violationsFixed\": 0,\n    \"auditsRun\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Targets\n\n**Quality:**\n- Average quality score: ≥95%\n- A11y compliance: 100%\n- Design system compliance: 100%\n- Token compliance: ≥95%\n\n**Speed:**\n- Average time per component: ≤10 minutes\n- Planning time: 2-3 minutes\n- Refinement iterations: 2-3 rounds\n- Visual regression test: <30 seconds\n\n**Code Health:**\n- Provider duplication: 0%\n- Code reduction: ≥70%\n- Test coverage: ≥90%\n- Visual regression pass rate: ≥98%\n\n**Workflow Efficiency:**\n- Components using composition: ≥80%\n- Components needing refinement: ≤30%\n- Blocking issues rate: ≤5%\n- Auto-fix success rate: ≥90%\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What's New in v3\n\n### Major Enhancements\n\n**1.

Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (Optional but Encouraged)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools. However, MCPs significantly enhance the development experience when available.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Recommended MCPs (Optional but Encouraged)\n\n**🎭 Playwright (Screenshot Automation & Visual Testing)**\n- **Purpose:** Automated screenshot capture, visual regression testing, browser automation\n- **Alternative:** Manual browser testing\n- **Benefit:** Automated visual validation and screenshot comparison\n- **Status:** Optional but highly recommended for visual workflows\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**🌐 Firecrawl (Web Content Research)**\n- **Purpose:** Research design patterns, fetch documentation, analyze competitor UIs\n- **Alternative:** Manual web research\n- **Benefit:** Automated design research and pattern discovery\n- **Status:** Optional but helpful for design research\n- **Requires:** `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` environment variable\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"firecrawl\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@firecrawl/mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\": \"${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**🎨 Tailwind CSS (Utility Class Reference)**\n- **Purpose:** Quick Tailwind utility lookup, class validation\n- **Alternative:** Tailwind docs website\n- **Benefit:** In-context Tailwind documentation\n- **Status:** Optional (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"tailwind-css\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@tailwindcss/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**🧩 Shadcn (Component Reference)**\n- **Purpose:** Reference unstyled component patterns\n- **Alternative:** Headless UI documentation\n- **Benefit:** Additional component pattern inspiration\n- **Status:** Optional (we primarily use Headless UI)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"shadcn-vue\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"shadcn-vue-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Environment Variables Setup (if using MCPs with auth)\n\n```bash\n# In your shell profile (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc.)\nexport FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"your-api-key-here\"\n\n# Or in project .env (gitignored)\nFIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here\n```\n\n#### Complete MCP Configuration Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    },\n    \"firecrawl\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@firecrawl/mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\": \"${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"tailwind-css\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@tailwindcss/mcp@latest\"]\n    },\n    \"shadcn-vue\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"shadcn-vue-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Start without MCPs and add them as needed. Core workflow is fully functional without any MCPs.\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:** Core tools only (no MCPs required)\n- `read`, `grep`, `glob` (file operations and search)\n- `edit` (design-system.css updates)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:** Core tools for component creation\n- `write`, `edit` (component creation and modification)\n- Reference: Socialaize component templates (see below)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**Socialaize Component Template:**\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP - OPTIONAL, see note below)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read` (file inspection)\n\n**Note on Playwright:**\nPlaywright MCP is **OPTIONAL**. For manual testing:\n1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`\n2. Navigate to component test page\n3. Toggle dark mode: `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')`\n4. Test responsive: Browser DevTools\n5. Take screenshots manually if needed\n\nIf you want automated screenshots, add Playwright MCP (see MCP Configuration section above).\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3.

Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB.

Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1.

Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n# Verify Node.js 18+\nnode --version\n\n# Install Playwright browsers\nnpx playwright install chromium\n\n# Verify Prettier installed\nnpm list prettier\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Create CLAUDE.md\n\n**CRITICAL FIRST STEP:** Create `/CLAUDE.md` in your project root.\n\nSee the [CLAUDE.md Setup](#claudemd-setup) section above for comprehensive guidance on what to include.\n\n**Quick Start Template:**\n\n```markdown\n# Socialaize Project Guide for Claude\n\n## Quick Commands\nnpm run dev       # Start dev\nnpm run test      # Run tests\nnpm run lint      # Lint code\n\n## Code Rules\n✅ Always: <script setup lang=\"ts\">, type-only props, Tailwind classes\n❌ Never: Runtime props, @apply, inline styles, hardcoded colors\n\n## Architecture\n[Your project structure]\n\n## Workflow\n1. Search existing components first\n2. Use provider pattern for platforms\n3. Compose before creating\n4. Run lint before commit\n\n[Add your specific project details]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Configure Permissions\n\nCreate `.claude/permissions.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\"ls\", \"cat\", \"grep\", \"git status\", \"git diff\"],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\"rm\", \"git commit\", \"npm install\"],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\"src/components/vue/\", \"src/styles/\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\nMCPs are **optional**. All core functionality works without them.\n\nIf you want automated screenshot testing, create `.mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**No environment variables needed** - core workflow uses built-in tools only.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Directory Structure\n\n```bash\n# Create required directories\nmkdir -p .claude/agents\nmkdir -p .claude/commands\nmkdir -p .claude/output-styles\nmkdir -p .claude/hooks\nmkdir -p screenshots\nmkdir -p tests/visual-baselines\nmkdir -p docs/components\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Subagent Files\n\n**Create 4 files in `.claude/agents/`:**\n\n1. `ui-analyzer.md` - Design analysis + token management\n2. `ui-builder.md` - Component generation\n3. `ui-validator.md` - Visual testing + quality checks\n4. `ui-documenter.md` - Documentation generation\n\n*Detailed agent definitions available in separate implementation guide.*\n\n---\n\n### 7. Command Files\n\n**Create files in `.claude/commands/`:**\n\n1. `ui-plan.md` - Strategic planning\n2. `ui-create.md` - Full creation pipeline\n3. `ui-variants.md` - Variant generation\n4. `ui-review.md` - Component analysis\n5. `ui-compose.md` - Component composition\n6. `ui-batch-update.md` - Bulk operations\n7. `ui-screenshot.md` - Quick screenshots\n8. `ui-visual-regression.md` - Visual diff testing\n9. `ui-validate-tokens.md` - Token compliance\n10. `ui-provider-refactor.md` - Provider pattern refactor\n11. `ui-document.md` - Documentation generation\n\n*Detailed command definitions available in separate implementation guide.*\n\n---\n\n### 8. Output Style\n\n**Create:** `~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md`\n\nCopy the implementation from the [Output Style section](#output-style-ui-designer) above.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Test the System\n\n```bash\n# Start Claude Code\nclaude\n\n# Activate ui-designer mode\n/output-style ui-designer\n\n# Test planning workflow\n/ui-plan Badge with status colors\n\n# Test component creation\n/ui-create Badge with status colors\n\n# Test variant generation\n/ui-variants 3 Card for displaying posts\n\n# Test composition\n/ui-compose BaseModal + TextInput\n\n# Test review\n/ui-review src/components/vue/buttons/PrimaryButton.vue\n\n# Test visual regression\n/ui-visual-regression src/components/vue/buttons/PrimaryButton.vue\n\n# Test token validation\n/ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Quality Metrics\n\n### Track System Effectiveness\n\n**File:** `.claude/metrics.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"components\": {\n    \"created\": 0,\n    \"reviewed\": 0,\n    \"composed\": 0,\n    \"refactored\": 0,\n    \"planned\": 0\n  },\n  \"quality\": {\n    \"avgScore\": 0,\n    \"autoFixed\": 0,\n    \"manualFixes\": 0\n  },\n  \"accessibility\": {\n    \"issuesFound\": 0,\n    \"issuesFixed\": 0,\n    \"compliance\": 0\n  },\n  \"efficiency\": {\n    \"avgTimePerComponent\": 0,\n    \"variantsGenerated\": 0,\n    \"iterationsPerComponent\": 0,\n    \"planningTimeAvg\": 0\n  },\n  \"codeReduction\": {\n    \"providerDuplication\": 57,\n    \"linesRemoved\": 0,\n    \"targetReduction\": 3050\n  },\n  \"visualRegression\": {\n    \"testsRun\": 0,\n    \"changesDetected\": 0,\n    \"baselineUpdates\": 0\n  },\n  \"tokenCompliance\": {\n    \"avgScore\": 0,\n    \"violationsFixed\": 0,\n    \"auditsRun\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Targets\n\n**Quality:**\n- Average quality score: ≥95%\n- A11y compliance: 100%\n- Design system compliance: 100%\n- Token compliance: ≥95%\n\n**Speed:**\n- Average time per component: ≤10 minutes\n- Planning time: 2-3 minutes\n- Refinement iterations: 2-3 rounds\n- Visual regression test: <30 seconds\n\n**Code Health:**\n- Provider duplication: 0%\n- Code reduction: ≥70%\n- Test coverage: ≥90%\n- Visual regression pass rate: ≥98%\n\n**Workflow Efficiency:**\n- Components using composition: ≥80%\n- Components needing refinement: ≤30%\n- Blocking issues rate: ≤5%\n- Auto-fix success rate: ≥90%\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What's New in v3\n\n### Major Enhancements\n\n**1.

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (Optional but Encouraged)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools. However, MCPs significantly enhance the development experience when available.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Recommended MCPs (Optional but Encouraged)\n\n**🎭 Playwright (Screenshot Automation & Visual Testing)**\n- **Purpose:** Automated screenshot capture, visual regression testing, browser automation\n- **Alternative:** Manual browser testing\n- **Benefit:** Automated visual validation and screenshot comparison\n- **Status:** Optional but highly recommended for visual workflows\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**🌐 Firecrawl (Web Content Research)**\n- **Purpose:** Research design patterns, fetch documentation, analyze competitor UIs\n- **Alternative:** Manual web research\n- **Benefit:** Automated design research and pattern discovery\n- **Status:** Optional but helpful for design research\n- **Requires:** `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` environment variable\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"firecrawl\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@firecrawl/mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\": \"${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**🎨 Tailwind CSS (Utility Class Reference)**\n- **Purpose:** Quick Tailwind utility lookup, class validation\n- **Alternative:** Tailwind docs website\n- **Benefit:** In-context Tailwind documentation\n- **Status:** Optional (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"tailwind-css\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@tailwindcss/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**🧩 Shadcn (Component Reference)**\n- **Purpose:** Reference unstyled component patterns\n- **Alternative:** Headless UI documentation\n- **Benefit:** Additional component pattern inspiration\n- **Status:** Optional (we primarily use Headless UI)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"shadcn-vue\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"shadcn-vue-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Environment Variables Setup (if using MCPs with auth)\n\n```bash\n# In your shell profile (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc.)\nexport FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"your-api-key-here\"\n\n# Or in project .env (gitignored)\nFIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here\n```\n\n#### Complete MCP Configuration Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    },\n    \"firecrawl\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@firecrawl/mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\": \"${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"tailwind-css\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@tailwindcss/mcp@latest\"]\n    },\n    \"shadcn-vue\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"shadcn-vue-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Start without MCPs and add them as needed. Core workflow is fully functional without any MCPs.\n\n---\n\n## 🤖 Core Agents\n\n### 1. ui-analyzer\n**Merged:** design-analyzer + style-system-expert\n\n**Role:** Design intelligence and token management\n\n**Tools:**\n- Core: `read`, `grep`, `glob`, `edit` (always available)\n- Optional MCPs: `firecrawl` (design research), `tailwind-css` (utility lookup)\n- Works fully without MCPs, enhanced with them\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Design Analysis**\n- Screenshot/URL → extract colors, spacing, typography, layouts\n- Map to existing design-system.css tokens\n- Identify similar components (pattern matching)\n- Assess accessibility (contrast, touch targets, semantic structure)\n\n**B. Token Management**\n- Maintain `/src/styles/design-system.css`\n- Generate new color palettes (9 shades) only when necessary\n- Validate token usage across components\n- Ensure dark mode consistency\n- Convert CSS properties → Tailwind utilities\n\n**C. Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:** Core tools for component creation\n- `write`, `edit` (component creation and modification)\n- Reference: Socialaize component templates (see below)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**Socialaize Component Template:**\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP - OPTIONAL, see note below)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read` (file inspection)\n\n**Note on Playwright:**\nPlaywright MCP is **OPTIONAL**. For manual testing:\n1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`\n2. Navigate to component test page\n3. Toggle dark mode: `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')`\n4. Test responsive: Browser DevTools\n5. Take screenshots manually if needed\n\nIf you want automated screenshots, add Playwright MCP (see MCP Configuration section above).\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3. Component Structure**\n- ✅ File in correct directory\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Base* prefix only for foundation components\n- ✅ Imports organized: vue → external → internal\n- ✅ Props, emits, models declared before logic\n\n**4. Accessibility (Built into Playwright)**\n```typescript\n// Auto-included in validation\nimport { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright';\n\ntest('accessibility', async ({ page }) => {\n  await injectAxe(page);\n  await checkA11y(page, null, {\n    detailedReport: true,\n    detailedReportOptions: { html: true }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Checks:**\n- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (text), ≥ 3:1 (UI)\n- Touch targets ≥ 44x44px\n- Keyboard navigation functional\n- ARIA attributes present\n- Semantic HTML structure\n\n**C. Smart Auto-Fix**\n\n**Auto-Fixable (Applied Automatically):**\n```typescript\ninterface AutoFix {\n  type: 'dark-mode' | 'spacing' | 'aria' | 'typescript';\n  fix: string;\n  confidence: 'high' | 'medium';\n}\n\n// Example fixes:\nconst autoFixes: AutoFix[] = [\n  {\n    type: 'dark-mode',\n    fix: 'Add dark:bg-gray-800 to complement bg-white',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'spacing',\n    fix: 'Replace margin: 23px with m-6 (24px from spacing scale)',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'aria',\n    fix: 'Add aria-label=\"Close modal\" to button with X icon',\n    confidence: 'medium'  // Will ask user to confirm\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'typescript',\n    fix: 'Add return type annotation to computed property',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**Blocking Issues (Requires Manual Fix):**\n```typescript\ninterface BlockingIssue {\n  severity: 'critical';\n  category: 'security' | 'ssr' | 'validation' | 'performance';\n  message: string;\n  location: string;\n}\n\n// Examples that block component approval:\nconst blockingIssues: BlockingIssue[] = [\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'ssr',\n    message: 'Using window object without isClient check',\n    location: 'Line 45: window.localStorage'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'security',\n    message: 'v-html without sanitization',\n    location: 'Line 67: v-html=\"userInput\"'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'validation',\n    message: 'Required prop missing validation',\n    location: 'Props: userId (no type narrowing)'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**D. Quality Scoring**\n```typescript\ninterface QualityReport {\n  score: number;              // 0-100\n  autoFixed: AutoFix[];\n  warnings: string[];         // Non-blocking issues\n  blocking: BlockingIssue[];  // Must fix to proceed\n  passed: boolean;            // score >= 90 && no blocking issues\n  screenshots: string[];      // Paths to generated images\n}\n```\n\n**Scoring Rules:**\n- TypeScript strictness: 25 points\n- Styling patterns: 20 points\n- Component structure: 15 points\n- Accessibility: 25 points\n- Design system compliance: 15 points\n\n**Thresholds:**\n- **100%:** Perfect, auto-approve\n- **90-99%:** Minor warnings, proceed with user acknowledgment\n- **<90% OR blocking issues:** Must fix before proceeding\n\n**E. Visual Regression Testing**\n\n**New Feature:** Automated screenshot comparison for detecting UI changes.\n\n```typescript\ninterface VisualRegressionResult {\n  component: string;\n  baseline: string;           // Path to baseline screenshot\n  current: string;            // Path to current screenshot\n  diff: string;               // Path to diff image\n  pixelDifference: number;    // Number of different pixels\n  diffPercentage: number;     // 0-100\n  passed: boolean;            // diffPercentage < threshold\n  threshold: number;          // Default: 0.1%\n}\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. First run: Capture baseline screenshots\n2. Subsequent runs: Compare against baseline\n3. Generate pixel diff image (red highlights)\n4. Flag differences > 0.1% for review\n5. User can accept (update baseline) or reject (investigate)\n\n**Storage:**\n```\ntests/visual-baselines/\n  ComponentName/\n    desktop-light.png\n    desktop-dark.png\n    mobile-light.png\n    [etc...]\n    \nscreenshots/\n  ComponentName/\n    2025-10-22-14-30/    # Timestamped runs\n      desktop-light.png\n      desktop-dark.png\n      diff-desktop-light.png  # If differences found\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. ui-documenter\n**Documentation generator (on-demand only)**\n\n**Role:** Generate concise component documentation\n\n**Tools:**\n- `create_file`\n- `view`, `read` (extract component interface)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Documentation Format**\n```markdown\n# ComponentName\n\nOne-sentence description of what this component does.\n\n## Usage\n\n\\`\\`\\`vue\n<ComponentName\n  variant=\"primary\"\n  :loading=\"isLoading\"\n  @click=\"handleClick\"\n>\n  Button Text\n</ComponentName>\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n## Props\n\n| Prop | Type | Default | Description |\n|------|------|---------|-------------|\n| variant | `\"primary\" \\| \"secondary\"` | `\"primary\"` | Visual style |\n| loading | `boolean` | `false` | Shows spinner |\n| disabled | `boolean` | `false` | Disables interaction |\n\n## Events\n\n| Event | Payload | Description |\n|-------|---------|-------------|\n| click | `MouseEvent` | Emitted on button click |\n\n## Slots\n\n| Slot | Props | Description |\n|------|-------|-------------|\n| default | - | Button content |\n| icon | - | Custom icon slot |\n\n## Examples\n\n### Loading State\n\\`\\`\\`vue\n<ComponentName :loading=\"true\">Saving...</ComponentName>\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### With Icon\n\\`\\`\\`vue\n<ComponentName icon=\"mdi:check\">Save</ComponentName>\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n**CRITICAL: Conciseness Rules**\n- ❌ NO verbose explanations\n- ❌ NO redundant information\n- ❌ NO more than 3 examples\n- ✅ Max 150 words total\n- ✅ Tables for props/events/slots\n- ✅ Only most common use cases\n\n**B. Auto-Extract Component Interface**\n```typescript\n// Parse component file to extract:\ninterface ComponentInterface {\n  name: string;\n  props: PropDefinition[];\n  emits: EmitDefinition[];\n  slots: SlotDefinition[];\n  models: ModelDefinition[];\n}\n\n// Then generate markdown table from interface\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Custom Commands\n\n### Planning & Strategy\n\n#### `/ui-plan [description]`\n**NEW:** Strategic planning before component creation\n\n**Purpose:** Reduce bugs by 30% through detailed upfront planning. Forces architectural thinking before code.\n\n**Flow:**\n```\n1. Analyze requirements\n   → What is the component's purpose?\n   → What user interactions are needed?\n   → What states must be handled?\n\n2. Search existing components\n   → Can we extend something?\n   → Can we compose existing parts?\n   → Do we really need something new?\n\n3. Design system audit\n   → Which tokens apply?\n   → What patterns exist?\n   → A11y requirements?\n\n4. Generate implementation plan\n   → Component structure\n   → Props interface\n   → Computed classes strategy\n   → Slot requirements\n   → Test scenarios\n\n5. Present plan to user\n   → Wait for approval\n   → Discuss concerns\n   → Refine as needed\n\n6. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Proceed to implementation\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nYou: /ui-plan Multi-step form wizard for scheduling content across platforms\n\nMain Claude:\n📋 PLANNING MODE: Multi-Step Form Wizard\n\nLet me analyze this systematically before writing any code.\n\nSTEP 1: Requirements Analysis\n─────────────────────────────\nPurpose: Guide users through content scheduling with progress indication\nKey Interactions:\n  • Next/Previous navigation between steps\n  • Step validation before proceeding\n  • Save draft at any point\n  • Preview before final submission\n\nStates Required:\n  • Current step (1-4)\n  • Validation errors per step\n  • Loading state during save/submit\n  • Draft saved confirmation\n  • Completion state\n\nAccessibility:\n  • ARIA progress indicator\n  • Keyboard navigation (arrows + tab)\n  • Focus management between steps\n  • Screen reader announcements\n\nSTEP 2: Component Search\n─────────────────────────\nSearching existing components...\n  ✓ Found: BaseModal.vue (80% match)\n  ✓ Found: TextInput.vue, FileDropzone.vue, DatePicker.vue\n  ✗ No existing wizard/stepper pattern\n\nRECOMMENDATION: Create new BaseWizard.vue + compose existing inputs\n\nSTEP 3: Design System Audit\n────────────────────────────\nTokens to use:\n  • Colors: primary-500 (active), gray-300 (inactive), success-500 (complete)\n  • Spacing: space-4 between steps, space-6 for sections\n  • Typography: font-medium for step labels\n  • Effects: shadow-md for wizard container\n\nSimilar Patterns:\n  • BaseModal for container structure\n  • ProgressBar pattern from design system docs\n\nSTEP 4: Implementation Plan\n────────────────────────────\n\nA. Component Structure:\n```\nBaseWizard.vue              # Container + step management\n├─ WizardStep.vue          # Individual step wrapper (slot-based)\n└─ WizardProgress.vue      # Progress indicator component\n```\n\nB. Props Interface:\n```typescript\ninterface WizardProps {\n  steps: {\n    id: string;\n    label: string;\n    component?: Component;\n    validate?: () => Promise<boolean>;\n  }[];\n  currentStep?: number;\n  allowSkip?: boolean;\n  showProgress?: boolean;\n}\n```\n\nC. Computed Classes Strategy:\n```typescript\nconst stepClasses = computed(() => (index: number) => [\n  'wizard-step',\n  index === currentStep.value && 'active',\n  index < currentStep.value && 'completed',\n  'transition-all duration-300'\n]);\n```\n\nD. Slot Requirements:\n  • #step-{n} - Content for each step\n  • #header - Optional custom header\n  • #footer-actions - Custom action buttons\n\nE. Composition Strategy:\n  • Extends BaseModal for container\n  • Composes TextInput, FileDropzone, DatePicker in steps\n  • Uses provider pattern for platform selection\n\nF. Accessibility Approach:\n  • aria-label=\"Step {n} of {total}: {label}\"\n  • role=\"progressbar\" for progress indicator\n  • Focus trapped within wizard\n  • Keyboard shortcuts: Ctrl+→ (next), Ctrl+← (prev)\n\nG. Responsive Design:\n  • Mobile: Vertical stack, full width\n  • Desktop: Horizontal progress bar top\n\nH. Dark Mode:\n  • bg-white → dark:bg-gray-800\n  • border-gray-300 → dark:border-gray-600\n  • text-gray-900 → dark:text-gray-100\n\nSTEP 5: Test Scenarios\n───────────────────────\n1.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1. Visual-First Communication\n- ALWAYS provide ASCII mockups before code\n- Use visual comparisons when showing variants\n- Describe appearance first, implementation second\n- Highlight visual differences explicitly\n\n### 2. Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1.

Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n# Verify Node.js 18+\nnode --version\n\n# Install Playwright browsers\nnpx playwright install chromium\n\n# Verify Prettier installed\nnpm list prettier\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Create CLAUDE.md\n\n**CRITICAL FIRST STEP:** Create `/CLAUDE.md` in your project root.\n\nSee the [CLAUDE.md Setup](#claudemd-setup) section above for comprehensive guidance on what to include.\n\n**Quick Start Template:**\n\n```markdown\n# Socialaize Project Guide for Claude\n\n## Quick Commands\nnpm run dev       # Start dev\nnpm run test      # Run tests\nnpm run lint      # Lint code\n\n## Code Rules\n✅ Always: <script setup lang=\"ts\">, type-only props, Tailwind classes\n❌ Never: Runtime props, @apply, inline styles, hardcoded colors\n\n## Architecture\n[Your project structure]\n\n## Workflow\n1. Search existing components first\n2. Use provider pattern for platforms\n3. Compose before creating\n4. Run lint before commit\n\n[Add your specific project details]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Configure Permissions\n\nCreate `.claude/permissions.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\"ls\", \"cat\", \"grep\", \"git status\", \"git diff\"],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\"rm\", \"git commit\", \"npm install\"],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\"src/components/vue/\", \"src/styles/\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\nMCPs are **optional**. All core functionality works without them.\n\nIf you want automated screenshot testing, create `.mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**No environment variables needed** - core workflow uses built-in tools only.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Directory Structure\n\n```bash\n# Create required directories\nmkdir -p .claude/agents\nmkdir -p .claude/commands\nmkdir -p .claude/output-styles\nmkdir -p .claude/hooks\nmkdir -p screenshots\nmkdir -p tests/visual-baselines\nmkdir -p docs/components\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Subagent Files\n\n**Create 4 files in `.claude/agents/`:**\n\n1. `ui-analyzer.md` - Design analysis + token management\n2. `ui-builder.md` - Component generation\n3. `ui-validator.md` - Visual testing + quality checks\n4. `ui-documenter.md` - Documentation generation\n\n*Detailed agent definitions available in separate implementation guide.*\n\n---\n\n### 7. Command Files\n\n**Create files in `.claude/commands/`:**\n\n1. `ui-plan.md` - Strategic planning\n2. `ui-create.md` - Full creation pipeline\n3. `ui-variants.md` - Variant generation\n4. `ui-review.md` - Component analysis\n5. `ui-compose.md` - Component composition\n6. `ui-batch-update.md` - Bulk operations\n7. `ui-screenshot.md` - Quick screenshots\n8. `ui-visual-regression.md` - Visual diff testing\n9. `ui-validate-tokens.md` - Token compliance\n10. `ui-provider-refactor.md` - Provider pattern refactor\n11. `ui-document.md` - Documentation generation\n\n*Detailed command definitions available in separate implementation guide.*\n\n---\n\n### 8. Output Style\n\n**Create:** `~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md`\n\nCopy the implementation from the [Output Style section](#output-style-ui-designer) above.\n\n---\n\n### 9. Test the System\n\n```bash\n# Start Claude Code\nclaude\n\n# Activate ui-designer mode\n/output-style ui-designer\n\n# Test planning workflow\n/ui-plan Badge with status colors\n\n# Test component creation\n/ui-create Badge with status colors\n\n# Test variant generation\n/ui-variants 3 Card for displaying posts\n\n# Test composition\n/ui-compose BaseModal + TextInput\n\n# Test review\n/ui-review src/components/vue/buttons/PrimaryButton.vue\n\n# Test visual regression\n/ui-visual-regression src/components/vue/buttons/PrimaryButton.vue\n\n# Test token validation\n/ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Quality Metrics\n\n### Track System Effectiveness\n\n**File:** `.claude/metrics.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"components\": {\n    \"created\": 0,\n    \"reviewed\": 0,\n    \"composed\": 0,\n    \"refactored\": 0,\n    \"planned\": 0\n  },\n  \"quality\": {\n    \"avgScore\": 0,\n    \"autoFixed\": 0,\n    \"manualFixes\": 0\n  },\n  \"accessibility\": {\n    \"issuesFound\": 0,\n    \"issuesFixed\": 0,\n    \"compliance\": 0\n  },\n  \"efficiency\": {\n    \"avgTimePerComponent\": 0,\n    \"variantsGenerated\": 0,\n    \"iterationsPerComponent\": 0,\n    \"planningTimeAvg\": 0\n  },\n  \"codeReduction\": {\n    \"providerDuplication\": 57,\n    \"linesRemoved\": 0,\n    \"targetReduction\": 3050\n  },\n  \"visualRegression\": {\n    \"testsRun\": 0,\n    \"changesDetected\": 0,\n    \"baselineUpdates\": 0\n  },\n  \"tokenCompliance\": {\n    \"avgScore\": 0,\n    \"violationsFixed\": 0,\n    \"auditsRun\": 0\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Success Targets\n\n**Quality:**\n- Average quality score: ≥95%\n- A11y compliance: 100%\n- Design system compliance: 100%\n- Token compliance: ≥95%\n\n**Speed:**\n- Average time per component: ≤10 minutes\n- Planning time: 2-3 minutes\n- Refinement iterations: 2-3 rounds\n- Visual regression test: <30 seconds\n\n**Code Health:**\n- Provider duplication: 0%\n- Code reduction: ≥70%\n- Test coverage: ≥90%\n- Visual regression pass rate: ≥98%\n\n**Workflow Efficiency:**\n- Components using composition: ≥80%\n- Components needing refinement: ≤30%\n- Blocking issues rate: ≤5%\n- Auto-fix success rate: ≥90%\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 What's New in v3\n\n### Major Enhancements\n\n**1.

Project Overview**\n```markdown\n# Socialaize - Project Overview\nBrief description of what the project does and its core purpose.\nFocus areas and primary use cases.\n```\n\n**2. Tech Stack Details**\n```markdown\n## Tech Stack\n\n**Frontend:**\n- Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Astro (SSR + SSG hybrid rendering)\n\n**Backend:**\n- Appwrite (databases, auth, storage, functions)\n\n**State Management:**\n- Nanostores with BaseStore pattern extending Appwrite collections\n- Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n**Styling:**\n- Tailwind CSS + CSS custom properties (design-system.css)\n- Part 1 enhancements: Extended color scales, shadow utilities, focus-ring utilities\n\n**Animations:**\n- VueUse Motion (@vueuse/motion) - Declarative animations\n- Web Animations API (useAnimateElement composable)\n- Animation presets (useAnimationPresets.ts)\n- Constants (ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING from @/constants/animations)\n- Tailwind animation utilities (animate-fade-in, transition-fast, etc.)\n\n**Icons:**\n- @iconify/vue with mdi (Material Design Icons) and simple-icons collections\n\n**UI Components:**\n- Headless UI (@headlessui/vue) - Unstyled accessible components\n- Floating UI - Positioning engine for tooltips/popovers\n- Custom base components (src/components/vue/base/)\n\n**Validation:**\n- Zod schemas for all data validation\n\n**Deployment:**\n- Cloudflare\n\n**Testing:**\n- Vitest (unit tests)\n- Playwright (e2e - optional, manual testing also supported)\n```\n\n**3. Quick Commands**\n```markdown\n## Development Commands\n# List all npm scripts with descriptions\nnpm run dev              # Start dev server\nnpm run build           # Production build\nnpm run preview         # Preview build\nnpm run test            # Run tests\nnpm run lint            # ESLint\nnpm run typecheck       # TypeScript checking\nnpm run format          # Prettier formatting\n```\n\n**4. Code Style Standards**\n```markdown\n## Strict Code Patterns\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">` for all Vue components\n✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>` (NO runtime validation)\n✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model patterns\n✅ Design-system.css tokens for all colors/spacing\n✅ PascalCase.vue naming convention\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n❌ `@apply` directives in <style> blocks\n❌ Inline `style=\"\"` attributes\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb color values\n❌ Custom px spacing values\n```\n\n**5. Architecture & File Structure**\n```markdown\n## Project Architecture\nsrc/\n├── components/vue/       # All Vue components\n│   ├── ui/              # Design system UI components\n│   ├── base/            # Foundation components\n│   ├── buttons/         # Button variants\n│   ├── cards/           # Card components\n│   ├── modals/          # Modal/dialog components\n│   └── inputs/          # Form input components\n├── config/              # Configuration files\n│   └── providers.ts     # Social platform provider config\n├── styles/\n│   └── design-system.css # Design tokens (CSS custom properties)\n├── stores/              # Nanostore state management\n└── pages/               # Astro pages\n\n[Include visual tree structure for clarity]\n```\n\n**6. Design System Guidelines**\n```markdown\n## Design System\nLocation: `src/styles/design-system.css`\n\n### Token Naming Convention\n--color-{semantic}-{shade}     # Example: --color-primary-500\n--spacing-{size}               # Use Tailwind scale\n--font-{family}               # Example: --font-sans\n\n### Component Search Strategy\n1. ALWAYS search existing components first\n2. Use grep/ls to find similar patterns\n3. Compose from existing when possible\n4. Create new only when justified\n```\n\n**7. Workflow Rules**\n```markdown\n## Git & Development Workflow\n- Branch naming: `feature/description` or `fix/description`\n- Always branch from `main`\n- Run linter before commits\n- Write tests for new functionality\n- Update documentation when adding components\n```\n\n**8. Provider Pattern Usage**\n```markdown\n## Social Platform Components\nUse BaseProviderCard + providers.ts config\nDO NOT create platform-specific duplicate components\nTo add new platform: Update config only (~10 lines)\n\nExample:\n<BaseProviderCard platform=\"facebook\" :account=\"data\" />\n```\n\n**9. Performance & Accessibility**\n```markdown\n## Non-Negotiable Standards\n- Lazy load heavy components\n- Use v-memo for expensive lists\n- Minimum AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 text, 3:1 UI)\n- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements\n- Touch targets minimum 44x44px\n- ARIA labels where semantic HTML insufficient\n```\n\n**10. AI Agent Context**\n```markdown\n## Claude Code Integration\nThis project uses specialized subagents:\n- ui-analyzer: Design analysis + token management\n- ui-builder: Component generation\n- ui-validator: Visual testing + quality enforcement\n- ui-documenter: Documentation generation\n\nAvailable slash commands:\n/ui-plan, /ui-create, /ui-variants, /ui-compose, \n/ui-review, /ui-batch-update, /ui-screenshot,\n/ui-visual-regression, /ui-validate-tokens\n```\n\n**11. Common Patterns & Templates**\nInclude code templates for:\n- Standard Vue component structure\n- Nanostore usage patterns\n- Appwrite integration examples\n- Zod validation schemas\n- Common composition patterns\n\n**12. Known Issues & Gotchas**\n```markdown\n## Platform-Specific Notes\n- Mac Pro (2019): May need GPU acceleration disabled for Playwright\n- Safari: Test thoroughly (common layout issues)\n- Astro SSG: Ensure Vue components are client-only when needed\n- Tailwind JIT: Must be enabled for custom classes\n```\n\n**13. Resource Links**\n```markdown\n## Documentation\n- [Vue 3 Docs](https://vuejs.org/)\n- [Astro Docs](https://docs.astro.build/)\n- [Shadcn-UI/Vue](https://www.shadcn-vue.com/)\n- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)\n- [Appwrite Docs](https://appwrite.io/docs)\n- [Nanostore](https://github.com/nanostores/nanostores)\n```\n\n**Best Practices for CLAUDE.md:**\n- Keep it under 500 lines (Claude has token limits)\n- Use clear headings and structure\n- Include examples, not just rules\n- Update it as the project evolves\n- Make it scannable with bullets and code blocks\n- Focus on what's unique to YOUR project\n\n---\n\n### Permission Management\n\n**Purpose:** Balance automation speed with safety through flexible permission modes.\n\n#### Permission Modes\n\n**1. Default Mode (Safest)**\n```bash\nclaude\n```\n- Asks permission for every file operation\n- Good for: Unfamiliar codebases, critical changes\n- Speed: Slower but safer\n\n**2. Accept Edits Mode (Recommended)**\n```bash\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n- Auto-approves file changes\n- Still asks for destructive operations\n- Good for: Active development sessions\n- Speed: Fast and practical\n\n**3. Plan Mode (Review-Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --plan\n```\n- Read-only access\n- Perfect for code reviews and planning\n- Cannot modify files\n- Good for: Architecture review, design discussions\n\n**4. Bypass Permissions (Trusted Only)**\n```bash\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n- Full automation, no prompts\n- ⚠️ Use ONLY in trusted environments\n- Good for: Batch operations, CI/CD, containers\n- Speed: Fastest but requires trust\n\n#### Permission Configuration File\n\n**Location:** `.claude/permissions.json`\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\n    \"ls\",\n    \"cat\",\n    \"grep\",\n    \"find\",\n    \"git status\",\n    \"git diff\",\n    \"npm run lint\",\n    \"npm run typecheck\",\n    \"npm test -- --run\"\n  ],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\n    \"rm\",\n    \"mv\",\n    \"git commit\",\n    \"git push\",\n    \"npm install\",\n    \"npm run build\",\n    \"npx\",\n    \"playwright codegen\"\n  ],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\n    \"src/components/vue/\",\n    \"src/styles/\",\n    \".claude/\",\n    \"tests/\"\n  ],\n  \"blockedCommands\": [\n    \"rm -rf /\",\n    \"sudo\",\n    \"format\",\n    \"dd\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Usage Recommendations\n\n**During Active Development:**\n```bash\n# Most common - fast iteration\nclaude --accept-edits\n```\n\n**For Code Review:**\n```bash\n# Safe exploration\nclaude --plan\n```\n\n**For Batch Operations:**\n```bash\n# In Docker container or VM\nclaude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\n**Tip:** Start session with `/permissions` command to view and adjust current settings.\n\n---\n\n### MCP Configuration (Optional but Encouraged)\n\n**Location:** `.mcp.json` (project root or `~/.claude/`)\n\nMCPs are **optional** for this workflow. All core functionality works with built-in tools. However, MCPs significantly enhance the development experience when available.\n\n#### Core Tools (Always Available)\n- read, write, edit - File operations\n- grep, glob - Search and pattern matching\n- bash - Command execution\n\n#### Recommended MCPs (Optional but Encouraged)\n\n**🎭 Playwright (Screenshot Automation & Visual Testing)**\n- **Purpose:** Automated screenshot capture, visual regression testing, browser automation\n- **Alternative:** Manual browser testing\n- **Benefit:** Automated visual validation and screenshot comparison\n- **Status:** Optional but highly recommended for visual workflows\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**🌐 Firecrawl (Web Content Research)**\n- **Purpose:** Research design patterns, fetch documentation, analyze competitor UIs\n- **Alternative:** Manual web research\n- **Benefit:** Automated design research and pattern discovery\n- **Status:** Optional but helpful for design research\n- **Requires:** `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` environment variable\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"firecrawl\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@firecrawl/mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\": \"${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**🎨 Tailwind CSS (Utility Class Reference)**\n- **Purpose:** Quick Tailwind utility lookup, class validation\n- **Alternative:** Tailwind docs website\n- **Benefit:** In-context Tailwind documentation\n- **Status:** Optional (we have complete Tailwind config from Part 1)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"tailwind-css\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@tailwindcss/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**🧩 Shadcn (Component Reference)**\n- **Purpose:** Reference unstyled component patterns\n- **Alternative:** Headless UI documentation\n- **Benefit:** Additional component pattern inspiration\n- **Status:** Optional (we primarily use Headless UI)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"shadcn-vue\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"shadcn-vue-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Environment Variables Setup (if using MCPs with auth)\n\n```bash\n# In your shell profile (.zshrc, .bashrc, etc.)\nexport FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=\"your-api-key-here\"\n\n# Or in project .env (gitignored)\nFIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-api-key-here\n```\n\n#### Complete MCP Configuration Example\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    },\n    \"firecrawl\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@firecrawl/mcp-server@latest\"],\n      \"env\": {\n        \"FIRECRAWL_API_KEY\": \"${FIRECRAWL_API_KEY}\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"tailwind-css\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@tailwindcss/mcp@latest\"]\n    },\n    \"shadcn-vue\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"shadcn-vue-mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** Start without MCPs and add them as needed.

Component Search (Step 0) - Socialaize-Specific Patterns**\nBefore creating new components:\n```bash\n# Search existing base components\nls src/components/vue/base/\n\n# Search animation presets\ngrep -r \"export const.*Preset\" src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n\n# Search for similar component patterns\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check animation usage\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Search by pattern\ngrep -r \"variant.*primary.*secondary\" src/components/vue/\ngrep -r \"loading.*disabled\" src/components/vue/buttons/\n\n# Semantic search\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*icon.*badge\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**Output Format:**\n```typescript\ninterface AnalysisResult {\n  // Step 0: Search results\n  existingComponents: {\n    path: string;\n    similarity: number;        // 0-100%\n    extendable: boolean;       // Can we extend vs recreate?\n    reason: string;\n  }[];\n  \n  // Design tokens\n  tokens: {\n    colors: Record<string, string>;      // Maps to CSS vars\n    spacing: Record<string, string>;\n    typography: Record<string, string>;\n    effects: Record<string, string>;\n  };\n  \n  // Layout analysis\n  layout: {\n    type: \"flex\" | \"grid\" | \"absolute\";\n    direction?: string;\n    classes: string;             // Tailwind classes\n  };\n  \n  // Reusable patterns found\n  patterns: {\n    components: string[];        // Similar components\n    composable: string[];        // Patterns that could be composed\n  };\n  \n  // Accessibility\n  accessibility: {\n    score: number;               // 0-100\n    issues: string[];\n    autoFixable: string[];       // Can fix automatically\n    blockingIssues: string[];    // Must fix manually\n  };\n  \n  // Recommendations\n  recommendations: {\n    action: \"extend\" | \"compose\" | \"create\";\n    baseComponent?: string;\n    reason: string;\n    estimatedTime: string;\n  }[];\n}\n```\n\n**Token Creation Rules:**\n```css\n/* Only create new tokens if NO existing token works */\n\n/* Example: User wants \"slightly darker than primary-500\" */\n❌ DON'T: Create --color-primary-550\n✅ DO: Use existing --color-primary-600\n\n/* Example: User wants custom brand color */\n✅ DO: Create new semantic token\n--color-brand-500 (and full 9-shade palette)\n\n/* Update design-system.css */\n:root {\n  --color-brand-50: #...; \n  /* ... */\n  --color-brand-900: #...;\n}\n\n[data-theme=\"dark\"] {\n  /* Adjust for dark mode */\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. ui-builder\n**Core implementation agent**\n\n**Role:** Generate high-quality Vue components following Socialaize patterns\n\n**Tools:**\n- Core: `write`, `edit`, `read`, `bash` (always available)\n- Optional MCPs: `shadcn-vue` (component patterns), `tailwind-css` (utility reference)\n- Works fully without MCPs, enhanced with them\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Variant Generation**\n- Generate **3 variants by default** (can be overridden)\n- Each variant explores different:\n  - Layout approaches\n  - Animation styles (@vueuse/motion)\n  - Interaction patterns\n  - Composition strategies\n\n**B. Strict Pattern Enforcement**\n\n**ALWAYS:**\n- ✅ `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- ✅ Type-only `defineProps<{}>`\n- ✅ Pure Tailwind utilities (NO @apply, NO inline styles)\n- ✅ `computed()` for reactive Tailwind classes\n- ✅ `defineModel<T>()` for v-model\n- ✅ Typed emits: `defineEmits<{ 'event': [Type] }>()`\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Correct directory placement\n- ✅ Design-system.css token references\n\n**NEVER:**\n- ❌ Runtime prop validation `defineProps({})`\n- ❌ `@apply` in styles\n- ❌ Inline `style=\"\"`\n- ❌ Direct color values (use CSS vars)\n- ❌ Custom spacing (use Tailwind scale)\n\n**Socialaize Component Template:**\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\n**C. Component Composition**\nWhen ui-analyzer finds similar components:\n```vue\n<!-- Option 1: Extend existing component -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseButton from '@vue/base/Button.vue';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  // Add only NEW props\n  socialPlatform: 'facebook' | 'instagram';\n}>();\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseButton \n    v-bind=\"$attrs\"\n    :icon=\"platformIcon\"\n    :class=\"platformStyles\"\n  >\n    <slot />\n  </BaseButton>\n</template>\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Option 2: Compose multiple components -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport BaseModal from '@vue/modals/BaseModal.vue';\nimport FileDropzone from '@vue/inputs/FileDropzone.vue';\nimport TextInput from '@vue/inputs/TextInput.vue';\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <BaseModal title=\"Upload Media\">\n    <FileDropzone @upload=\"handleFiles\" />\n    <TextInput label=\"Caption\" v-model=\"caption\" />\n  </BaseModal>\n</template>\n```\n\n**D. Provider Pattern (Composition over Duplication)**\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const PROVIDERS = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'mdi:facebook',\n    color: '#1877f2',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels'],\n    authScopes: ['pages_manage_posts', 'pages_read_engagement']\n  },\n  instagram: {\n    name: 'Instagram',\n    icon: 'mdi:instagram', \n    color: '#e4405f',\n    features: ['posts', 'stories', 'reels', 'igtv'],\n    authScopes: ['instagram_basic', 'instagram_content_publish']\n  },\n  // ... 8 more platforms\n} as const;\n\nexport type Platform = keyof typeof PROVIDERS;\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- BaseProviderCard.vue (ONE component for all platforms) -->\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { PROVIDERS, type Platform } from '@/config/providers';\n\nconst props = defineProps<{\n  platform: Platform;\n  account?: { username: string; followers: number };\n  connected?: boolean;\n}>();\n\nconst provider = PROVIDERS[props.platform];\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div :class=\"[\n    'provider-card border-2 rounded-lg p-4',\n    'hover:shadow-lg transition-all'\n  ]\" :style=\"{ borderColor: provider.color }\">\n    <Icon :icon=\"provider.icon\" :style=\"{ color: provider.color }\" />\n    <h3>{{ provider.name }}</h3>\n    <div v-if=\"account\" class=\"account-info\">\n      @{{ account.username }} • {{ account.followers }} followers\n    </div>\n    <slot name=\"actions\" />\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n**Usage:**\n```vue\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\"\n  :account=\"fbAccount\"\n  :connected=\"true\"\n>\n  <template #actions>\n    <Button @click=\"disconnect\">Disconnect</Button>\n  </template>\n</BaseProviderCard>\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ 1 base component instead of 11 duplicate cards\n- ✅ 1 config file instead of 9 login button variants\n- ✅ Add new platform = update config only\n- ✅ Consistent styling enforced\n- ✅ ~85% reduction in provider component files\n\n---\n\n### 3. ui-validator\n**Merged:** visual-tester + quality-enforcer\n\n**Role:** Visual testing and quality enforcement\n\n**Tools:**\n- `playwright` (MCP - OPTIONAL, see note below)\n- `bash`, `grep` (pattern matching)\n- `read` (file inspection)\n\n**Note on Playwright:**\nPlaywright MCP is **OPTIONAL**. For manual testing:\n1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`\n2. Navigate to component test page\n3. Toggle dark mode: `document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark')`\n4. Test responsive: Browser DevTools\n5. Take screenshots manually if needed\n\nIf you want automated screenshots, add Playwright MCP (see MCP Configuration section above).\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A. Screenshot Capture**\n**When:** After user approves variant OR on explicit `/ui-screenshot` command\n\n**Captures:**\n- Breakpoints: Mobile (375px), Tablet (768px), Desktop (1920px)\n- Themes: Light + Dark mode\n- States: Default, Hover, Active, Disabled, Loading\n- Variants: All prop variations if applicable\n\n**Playwright Pattern:**\n```typescript\n// Auto-generated test\nimport { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';\n\ntest.describe('ComponentName', () => {\n  test.beforeEach(async ({ page }) => {\n    await page.goto('http://localhost:4321/test/ComponentName');\n  });\n\n  test('responsive + themes', async ({ page }) => {\n    // Desktop light\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 1920, height: 1080 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-light.png' });\n    \n    // Desktop dark\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'dark'));\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-desktop-dark.png' });\n    \n    // Mobile light\n    await page.evaluate(() => document.documentElement.setAttribute('data-theme', 'light'));\n    await page.setViewportSize({ width: 375, height: 667 });\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-mobile-light.png' });\n  });\n\n  test('interaction states', async ({ page }) => {\n    const button = page.locator('[data-testid=\"button\"]');\n    \n    await button.hover();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-hover.png' });\n    \n    await button.click();\n    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshots/ComponentName-active.png' });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**B. Quality Checks**\n\n**1. TypeScript Strictness**\n```bash\n# Check for runtime props (FORBIDDEN)\n! grep -r \"defineProps({\" src/components/vue/\n\n# Check for type-only props (REQUIRED)\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**2. Styling Patterns**\n```bash\n# NO @apply\n! grep -r \"@apply\" src/components/vue/\n\n# NO inline styles\n! grep -r 'style=\"' src/components/vue/ | grep -v test\n\n# Only design-system.css token references\ngrep -r \"var(--color-\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n**3. Component Structure**\n- ✅ File in correct directory\n- ✅ PascalCase.vue naming\n- ✅ Base* prefix only for foundation components\n- ✅ Imports organized: vue → external → internal\n- ✅ Props, emits, models declared before logic\n\n**4. Accessibility (Built into Playwright)**\n```typescript\n// Auto-included in validation\nimport { injectAxe, checkA11y } from 'axe-playwright';\n\ntest('accessibility', async ({ page }) => {\n  await injectAxe(page);\n  await checkA11y(page, null, {\n    detailedReport: true,\n    detailedReportOptions: { html: true }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n**Checks:**\n- Color contrast ≥ 4.5:1 (text), ≥ 3:1 (UI)\n- Touch targets ≥ 44x44px\n- Keyboard navigation functional\n- ARIA attributes present\n- Semantic HTML structure\n\n**C. Smart Auto-Fix**\n\n**Auto-Fixable (Applied Automatically):**\n```typescript\ninterface AutoFix {\n  type: 'dark-mode' | 'spacing' | 'aria' | 'typescript';\n  fix: string;\n  confidence: 'high' | 'medium';\n}\n\n// Example fixes:\nconst autoFixes: AutoFix[] = [\n  {\n    type: 'dark-mode',\n    fix: 'Add dark:bg-gray-800 to complement bg-white',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'spacing',\n    fix: 'Replace margin: 23px with m-6 (24px from spacing scale)',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'aria',\n    fix: 'Add aria-label=\"Close modal\" to button with X icon',\n    confidence: 'medium'  // Will ask user to confirm\n  },\n  {\n    type: 'typescript',\n    fix: 'Add return type annotation to computed property',\n    confidence: 'high'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**Blocking Issues (Requires Manual Fix):**\n```typescript\ninterface BlockingIssue {\n  severity: 'critical';\n  category: 'security' | 'ssr' | 'validation' | 'performance';\n  message: string;\n  location: string;\n}\n\n// Examples that block component approval:\nconst blockingIssues: BlockingIssue[] = [\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'ssr',\n    message: 'Using window object without isClient check',\n    location: 'Line 45: window.localStorage'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'security',\n    message: 'v-html without sanitization',\n    location: 'Line 67: v-html=\"userInput\"'\n  },\n  {\n    severity: 'critical',\n    category: 'validation',\n    message: 'Required prop missing validation',\n    location: 'Props: userId (no type narrowing)'\n  }\n];\n```\n\n**D. Quality Scoring**\n```typescript\ninterface QualityReport {\n  score: number;              // 0-100\n  autoFixed: AutoFix[];\n  warnings: string[];         // Non-blocking issues\n  blocking: BlockingIssue[];  // Must fix to proceed\n  passed: boolean;            // score >= 90 && no blocking issues\n  screenshots: string[];      // Paths to generated images\n}\n```\n\n**Scoring Rules:**\n- TypeScript strictness: 25 points\n- Styling patterns: 20 points\n- Component structure: 15 points\n- Accessibility: 25 points\n- Design system compliance: 15 points\n\n**Thresholds:**\n- **100%:** Perfect, auto-approve\n- **90-99%:** Minor warnings, proceed with user acknowledgment\n- **<90% OR blocking issues:** Must fix before proceeding\n\n**E. Visual Regression Testing**\n\n**New Feature:** Automated screenshot comparison for detecting UI changes.\n\n```typescript\ninterface VisualRegressionResult {\n  component: string;\n  baseline: string;           // Path to baseline screenshot\n  current: string;            // Path to current screenshot\n  diff: string;               // Path to diff image\n  pixelDifference: number;    // Number of different pixels\n  diffPercentage: number;     // 0-100\n  passed: boolean;            // diffPercentage < threshold\n  threshold: number;          // Default: 0.1%\n}\n```\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. First run: Capture baseline screenshots\n2. Subsequent runs: Compare against baseline\n3. Generate pixel diff image (red highlights)\n4. Flag differences > 0.1% for review\n5. User can accept (update baseline) or reject (investigate)\n\n**Storage:**\n```\ntests/visual-baselines/\n  ComponentName/\n    desktop-light.png\n    desktop-dark.png\n    mobile-light.png\n    [etc...]\n    \nscreenshots/\n  ComponentName/\n    2025-10-22-14-30/    # Timestamped runs\n      desktop-light.png\n      desktop-dark.png\n      diff-desktop-light.png  # If differences found\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. ui-documenter\n**Documentation generator (on-demand only)**\n\n**Role:** Generate concise component documentation\n\n**Tools:**\n- `create_file`\n- `view`, `read` (extract component interface)\n\n**Responsibilities:**\n\n**A.

Shows, Doesn't Tell\n```\n❌ Before (default): \"The card will have a white background with gray border and padding\"\n\n✅ After (ui-designer): \n┌────────────────────────────┐\n│  🎨 Design Name            │\n│  Brief description goes... │\n│  [Button] [Button]         │\n└────────────────────────────┘\n\"See mockup above. Thoughts?\"\n```\n\n### 2. Asks Visual Questions\n```\n❌ Before: \"What spacing do you want?\"\n\n✅ After:\n\"For the card padding:\n  A. Tight (p-3) ▢\n  B. Standard (p-4) ▢\n  C. Spacious (p-6) ▢\nWhich feels right?\"\n```\n\n### 3. Proactive Design Improvements\n```\n✅ ui-designer suggests:\n\"Nice button! A few thoughts:\n• Add hover:shadow-lg for depth\n• Consider @vueuse/motion for scale animation\n• Status color could use semantic token (success-500)\n\nWant me to apply these?\"\n```\n\n### 4. Design Terminology\n```\n❌ Before: \"We should use the same color as the other button\"\n\n✅ After: \"Let's use the primary-500 token for consistency with PrimaryButton.vue. This maintains our design system hierarchy.\"\n```\n\n### 5. Visual Comparison\nWhen showing variants:\n```\nVARIANT 1          VARIANT 2          VARIANT 3\n────────────────   ────────────────   ────────────────\n┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐   ┌──────────────┐\n│ Icon         │   │ ┌────┐       │   │  ┌─┐ Title   │\n│ Title        │   │ │Icon│ Title │   │  └─┘         │\n│ Description  │   │ └────┘       │   │  Description │\n│ [Action]     │   │ Description  │   │  [Action]    │\n└──────────────┘   │ [Action]     │   └──────────────┘\n                   └──────────────┘\n\nV1: Vertical stack, best for feature-rich\nV2: Horizontal with icon, balanced\nV3: Compact, best for dense layouts\n\nPick your favorite? (1/2/3)\n```\n\n### 6. Iteration Language\n```\n✅ ui-designer says:\n\"Looking at the screenshots:\n• Padding feels tight on mobile → Try p-4 instead of p-3?\n• Dark mode card needs more contrast → Lighter border?\n• Animation could be smoother → Add duration-300?\n\nWhich changes resonate?\"\n```\n\n**Implementation:**\n```markdown\n<!-- ~/.claude/output-styles/ui-designer.md -->\n---\nname: ui-designer\ndescription: Visual-first design partner for Vue component development\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design specialist for Socialaize's Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS design system.\n\n## Core Behaviors\n\n### 1. Visual-First Communication\n- ALWAYS provide ASCII mockups before code\n- Use visual comparisons when showing variants\n- Describe appearance first, implementation second\n- Highlight visual differences explicitly\n\n### 2. Design System Authority\n- Reference design-system.css tokens by name\n- Enforce token usage (no custom values)\n- Maintain dark mode consistency\n- Suggest semantic token improvements\n\n### 3. Iteration-Focused\n- Generate 3 variants upfront (unless specified otherwise)\n- Present side-by-side visual comparisons\n- Ask visual questions: \"lighter or darker?\", \"more padding?\"\n- Incorporate feedback quickly, visually\n\n### 4. Proactive Design Improvements\nWhen you see opportunities:\n- Suggest design tokens over hardcoded values\n- Recommend animations for interactions\n- Point out accessibility improvements\n- Notice inconsistencies with design system\n\n### 5. Design Terminology\nUse proper design language:\n- \"tokens\" not \"variables\"\n- \"variants\" not \"versions\"\n- \"composition\" not \"combining components\"\n- \"spacing scale\" not \"padding values\"\n\n### 6. Quality Obsession\nAlways check:\n- Color contrast ratios\n- Touch target sizes\n- Dark mode consistency\n- Design token usage\n- Component composition opportunities\n\n## Response Format\n\nFor component creation:\n```\n[ASCII Mockup]\n\nKey features:\n• Feature 1\n• Feature 2\n\nTechnical approach:\n[Concise code explanation]\n\nQuestions:\n1. Visual question\n2. Interaction question\n```\n\nFor iterations:\n```\nChanges applied:\n✓ Change 1\n✓ Change 2\n\n[Updated mockup or screenshot reference]\n\nBetter? (or feedback)\n```\n\n## Tone\n- Collaborative, not prescriptive\n- Visual, not verbose\n- Action-oriented\n- Design-focused, code-secondary\n\n## When Generating Components\nFollow all Socialaize patterns strictly:\n- `<script setup lang=\"ts\">`\n- Type-only props\n- Pure Tailwind utilities\n- Computed classes\n- Design-system.css tokens\n```\n\n---\n\n## 🎣 Hooks for Automation\n\n*Note: These are for future implementation after manual workflows are established.*\n\n### Pre-Component Creation\n**File:** `.claude/hooks/pre-component-check.js`\n\n```javascript\n#!/usr/bin/env node\nconst fs = require('fs');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nconst input = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(0, 'utf-8'));\nconst filePath = input.tool_input.file_path;\n\n// 1.

Prerequisites\n\n```bash\n# Verify Node.js 18+\nnode --version\n\n# Install Playwright browsers\nnpx playwright install chromium\n\n# Verify Prettier installed\nnpm list prettier\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Create CLAUDE.md\n\n**CRITICAL FIRST STEP:** Create `/CLAUDE.md` in your project root.\n\nSee the [CLAUDE.md Setup](#claudemd-setup) section above for comprehensive guidance on what to include.\n\n**Quick Start Template:**\n\n```markdown\n# Socialaize Project Guide for Claude\n\n## Quick Commands\nnpm run dev       # Start dev\nnpm run test      # Run tests\nnpm run lint      # Lint code\n\n## Code Rules\n✅ Always: <script setup lang=\"ts\">, type-only props, Tailwind classes\n❌ Never: Runtime props, @apply, inline styles, hardcoded colors\n\n## Architecture\n[Your project structure]\n\n## Workflow\n1. Search existing components first\n2. Use provider pattern for platforms\n3. Compose before creating\n4. Run lint before commit\n\n[Add your specific project details]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Configure Permissions\n\nCreate `.claude/permissions.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"autoAcceptCommands\": [\"ls\", \"cat\", \"grep\", \"git status\", \"git diff\"],\n  \"requireApproval\": [\"rm\", \"git commit\", \"npm install\"],\n  \"trustedDirectories\": [\"src/components/vue/\", \"src/styles/\"]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. MCP Configuration (OPTIONAL)\n\nMCPs are **optional**. All core functionality works without them.\n\nIf you want automated screenshot testing, create `.mcp.json`:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"playwright\": {\n      \"command\": \"npx\",\n      \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@playwright/mcp@latest\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**No environment variables needed** - core workflow uses built-in tools only.\n\n---\n\n### 5.

Expert in CSS custom properties, Tailwind utilities, and design pattern recognition.\ntools: read, grep, glob, edit\nmodel: claude-sonnet-4-20250514\n---\n\n---\n**SOCIALAIZE-SPECIFIC VERSION**\nUpdated: October 22, 2025\nTailored for: Vue 3 + Astro + Appwrite + Nanostore stack\nSee: SOC_UI_INTEGRATION.md for foundation details\nPart 1 Status: ✅ Complete (Tailwind config enhanced)\n---\n\nYou are a UI/UX design systems expert specializing in design token analysis, pattern recognition, and design-system.css management for Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS projects.\n\n## Core Responsibilities\n\n### 1. Design Token Analysis\n- Extract and validate CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n- Identify color schemes, spacing scales, typography systems\n- Detect token usage patterns across components\n- Flag hardcoded values that should use tokens\n\n### 2. Pattern Recognition\n- Search for similar existing components before creation\n- Identify composition opportunities\n- Detect duplication and suggest consolidation\n- Recognize provider patterns and reusable abstractions\n\n### 3. Design System Compliance\n- Validate components use only design tokens\n- Check for Tailwind utility class compliance\n- Identify @apply violations and inline styles\n- Ensure consistent naming conventions\n\n### 4. Token Management\n- Add new tokens to design-system.css when justified\n- Maintain token naming consistency\n- Document token usage and relationships\n- Suggest token deprecation when appropriate\n\n### 5. Design Quality Scoring\n- Analyze components against depth, typography, motion, and interactive state standards\n- Calculate quality scores for professional UI polish\n- Provide actionable recommendations for improvements\n- Report comprehensive design quality metrics\n\n## Context Discovery Process\n\nWhen invoked, ALWAYS:\n\n1. **Read design-system.css** (`src/styles/design-system.css`)\n   - Extract current token definitions\n   - Understand color system and scales\n   - Note spacing and typography tokens\n\n2. **Search component directory** (`src/components/vue/`)\n   ```bash\n   find src/components/vue -name \"*.vue\" | head -20\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for similar patterns**\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"class.*{pattern}\" src/components/vue/\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for duplication**\n   - Look for platform-specific components\n   - Identify repeated patterns\n   - Suggest provider/composition approach\n\n## Socialaize-Specific Search Patterns\n\nWhen analyzing components, use these search patterns:\n\n### Find Base Components\n```bash\nls src/components/vue/base/\n```\n\n### Find Animation Composables\n```bash\nls src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n```\n\n### Search for Variant Patterns\n```bash\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n### Find Icon Usage\n```bash\ngrep -r \"@iconify/vue\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n### Find Animation Usage\n```bash\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n### Find Nanostore Usage\n```bash\ngrep -r \"extends BaseStore\" src/stores/\n```\n\n## Analysis Output Format\n\nProvide analysis in this structure:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 Design Analysis\n\n### Existing Patterns Found\n- [List similar components with file paths]\n- [Composition opportunities identified]\n\n### Design Tokens Required\n- **Colors**: List required tokens\n- **Spacing**: List spacing needs\n- **Typography**: List font/size needs\n- **Missing Tokens**: New tokens to add\n\n### Compliance Issues\n- ❌ Hardcoded values found: [list]\n- ❌ Inline styles detected: [list]\n- ✅ Token usage: [percentage]\n\n### Recommendations\n1. [Reuse existing component X]\n2. [Add tokens: --color-{name}]\n3. [Refactor to provider pattern]\n```\n\n## Enhanced Scoring Metrics\n\n### Depth Score (0-100)\n- Detects border usage vs shadow/color layering\n- Checks for dual-shadow systems\n- Validates elevation hierarchy\n\n**Calculation:**\n- -10 points per border (except inputs/focus)\n- +20 points for shadow usage\n- +10 points for color layering (bg-gray-50/100 pattern)\n- +10 points for consistent shadow scale\n\n### Typography Score (0-100)\n- Validates font size scale compliance\n- Checks font weight appropriateness\n- Verifies line-height rules\n- Checks color contrast ratios\n\n**Calculation:**\n- +25 points for consistent font scale\n- +25 points for appropriate weights\n- +25 points for correct line heights\n- +25 points for WCAG AA contrast\n\n### Motion Score (0-100)\n- Checks animation duration appropriateness\n- Validates easing functions\n- Ensures accessible motion (prefers-reduced-motion)\n\n**Calculation:**\n- +40 points for appropriate durations (150-300ms)\n- +30 points for correct easing (ease-out default)\n- +30 points for accessibility support\n\n### Interactive States Score (0-100)\n- Validates presence of all required states\n- Checks focus ring implementation\n- Validates disabled state implementation\n\n**Calculation:**\n- +20 points per required state present (hover, focus, active, disabled)\n- +10 points for proper focus rings\n- +10 points for consistent disabled pattern\n\n### Scoring Report Format\n\n```\n📊 Design Quality Analysis\n\nDepth Score: 85/100\n- ✅ Uses shadow-md for elevation\n- ✅ Color layering (bg-gray-50 → bg-white)\n- ⚠️  Found 2 borders (should use shadows)\n- Recommendation: Replace borders with shadows + color depth\n\nTypography Score: 95/100\n- ✅ Font scale compliance\n- ✅ Appropriate weights (semibold for headings)\n- ✅ WCAG AA contrast (7.2:1 headings, 5.1:1 body)\n- ⚠️  One instance of line-height: 1.3 in body text (should be 1.5)\n\nMotion Score: 80/100\n- ✅ Duration: 200ms (appropriate)\n- ⚠️  Missing ease-out (using default)\n- ⚠️  No prefers-reduced-motion support\n\nInteractive States Score: 90/100\n- ✅ Hover state implemented\n- ✅ Focus ring present (ring-2 ring-primary-500)\n- ✅ Active state (scale-95)\n- ✅ Disabled state (proper styling)\n- ⚠️  Loading state could be improved\n\nOverall Design Score: 87/100 ⭐ GOOD\n\nTop Priority Fixes:\n1. Add prefers-reduced-motion support\n2. Replace borders with shadows\n3. Fix body text line-height\n```\n\n## Design System Rules\n\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n✅ Tailwind utility classes only\n✅ Computed classes for dynamic styling\n✅ Semantic token names (--color-primary, not --color-blue)\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb values\n❌ Inline style attributes\n❌ @apply directives\n❌ Custom px values not in design system\n\n## Token Naming Conventions\n\nFollow these patterns:\n- Colors: `--color-{semantic}-{shade}` (e.g., --color-primary-500)\n- Spacing: Use Tailwind scale (--spacing-4, --spacing-8)\n- Typography: `--font-{family}`, `--text-{size}`\n- Shadows: `--shadow-{size}`\n- Borders: `--border-{size}`\n- Radii: `--radius-{size}`\n\n## Search Strategy\n\n### Before Creating New Components:\n1. Search by functionality: `grep -r \"Button\" src/components/vue/`\n2. Search by pattern: `grep -r \"class.*btn\" src/components/vue/`\n3. Check ui/ and base/ directories first\n4. Look for provider patterns in config/\n\n### Composition Over Creation:\n- **Priority 1**: Reuse existing component\n- **Priority 2**: Compose from multiple components  \n- **Priority 3**: Extend base component\n- **Priority 4**: Create new only if justified\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- Limit initial context gathering to relevant files only\n- Use specific grep patterns for targeted searches\n- Focus on the most relevant 10-15 components\n- Don't read entire component directory at once\n\n## Communication Style\n\n- Be concise and actionable\n- Provide file paths for all references\n- Use bullet points for clarity\n- Include code examples when helpful\n- Flag critical issues immediately\n\n## Integration with Other Agents\n\n- **Feed to ui-builder**: Design tokens and patterns found\n- **Feed to ui-validator**: Compliance issues to check\n- **Feed to ui-documenter**: Token documentation needs\n\nYou work proactively - when you see requests for new components, AUTOMATICALLY analyze first before any code is written.","numLines":277,"startLine":1,"totalLines":277}}}

Text: 4.5:1 ratio minimum\n   - UI components: 3:1 ratio minimum\n\n## Performance Optimizations\n\n### When to Use:\n- `v-memo` for expensive computed lists\n- `v-once` for static content\n- `defineAsyncComponent` for heavy components\n- `computed()` instead of methods for derived state\n\n### Example:\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { computed, defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\n// Lazy load heavy component\nconst HeavyChart = defineAsyncComponent(() => \n  import('./HeavyChart.vue')\n)\n\n// Memoize expensive list rendering\nconst memoKey = computed(() => [items.value.length, sortOrder.value])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\" v-memo=\"memoKey\">\n    <!-- Expensive rendering -->\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n## File Naming & Location\n\n### Naming Convention:\n- **PascalCase.vue** (e.g., PrimaryButton.vue, UserCard.vue)\n\n### Directory Structure:\n```\nsrc/components/vue/\n├── ui/              # Core design system components\n├── base/            # Foundation components\n├── buttons/         # Button variants\n├── cards/           # Card components\n├── modals/          # Dialogs/modals\n└── inputs/          # Form inputs\n```\n\n## Provider Pattern Integration\n\nFor platform-specific components, use provider pattern:\n\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const providers = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'facebook',\n    color: '--color-facebook'\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Use BaseProviderCard instead of FacebookCard -->\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\" \n  :account=\"accountData\" \n/>\n```\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\nGenerate components that are easily testable:\n- Pure functions for complex logic\n- Props for all inputs\n- Events for all outputs\n- No direct DOM manipulation\n\n## Refinement Process\n\nAfter initial generation:\n\n1. **Round 1 - Polish**:\n   - Review code quality\n   - Enhance TypeScript types\n   - Improve class naming\n   - Add code comments\n\n2. **Round 2 - Performance & A11y**:\n   - Add v-memo where needed\n   - Verify ARIA labels\n   - Check keyboard navigation\n   - Optimize computed properties\n\n## Communication Style\n\n- Provide clear explanations for variant differences\n- Show before/after comparisons when refactoring\n- Highlight key features and trade-offs\n- Be concise but complete\n- Use code examples liberally\n\n## Integration with Other Agents\n\n- **Receive from ui-analyzer**: Design tokens, patterns to follow\n- **Feed to ui-validator**: Generated code for quality checks\n- **Feed to ui-documenter**: Component details for documentation\n\n## Socialaize-Specific Patterns\n\n### ✅ ALWAYS Use:\n\n- Import Icon from '@iconify/vue' (NOT custom SVG components)\n- Import animations from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/'\n- Import constants from '@/constants/animations'\n- Use existing base components from '@/components/vue/base/'\n- Extend BaseStore for Appwrite collections\n- Use Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n### ❌ NEVER Use:\n\n- Custom icon components (use @iconify/vue)\n- Custom animation utilities (use existing system)\n- Pinia or Vuex (use Nanostore + BaseStore)\n- shadcn components (we use Headless UI)\n\n### Animation Pattern\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\nconst { animate } = useAnimateElement()\n\nconst handleClick = () => {\n  animate(element.value, 'fadeIn', {\n    duration: ANIMATION_DURATION.FAST,\n    easing: EASING.EASE_OUT\n  })\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n### Icon Pattern\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <!-- Material Design Icons -->\n  <Icon icon=\"mdi:check-circle\" class=\"w-5 h-5 text-success-500\" />\n\n  <!-- Simple Icons (brands) -->\n  <Icon icon=\"simple-icons:facebook\" class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n### Nanostore Integration\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useStore } from '@nanostores/vue'\nimport { userStore } from '@/stores/UserStore'\n\n// UserStore extends BaseStore<User>\nconst user = useStore(userStore.$user)\nconst isLoading = useStore(userStore.$isLoading)\n</script>\n```\n\n### Component Template (Socialaize Standard)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\nYou generate production-ready Vue 3 components following strict patterns and always provide 3 variant options.","numLines":437,"startLine":1,"totalLines":437}}}

Design Token Analysis\n- Extract and validate CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n- Identify color schemes, spacing scales, typography systems\n- Detect token usage patterns across components\n- Flag hardcoded values that should use tokens\n\n### 2. Pattern Recognition\n- Search for similar existing components before creation\n- Identify composition opportunities\n- Detect duplication and suggest consolidation\n- Recognize provider patterns and reusable abstractions\n\n### 3. Design System Compliance\n- Validate components use only design tokens\n- Check for Tailwind utility class compliance\n- Identify @apply violations and inline styles\n- Ensure consistent naming conventions\n\n### 4. Token Management\n- Add new tokens to design-system.css when justified\n- Maintain token naming consistency\n- Document token usage and relationships\n- Suggest token deprecation when appropriate\n\n### 5. Design Quality Scoring\n- Analyze components against depth, typography, motion, and interactive state standards\n- Calculate quality scores for professional UI polish\n- Provide actionable recommendations for improvements\n- Report comprehensive design quality metrics\n\n## Context Discovery Process\n\nWhen invoked, ALWAYS:\n\n1. **Read design-system.css** (`src/styles/design-system.css`)\n   - Extract current token definitions\n   - Understand color system and scales\n   - Note spacing and typography tokens\n\n2. **Search component directory** (`src/components/vue/`)\n   ```bash\n   find src/components/vue -name \"*.vue\" | head -20\n   ```\n\n3. **Search for similar patterns**\n   ```bash\n   grep -r \"class.*{pattern}\" src/components/vue/\n   ```\n\n4. **Check for duplication**\n   - Look for platform-specific components\n   - Identify repeated patterns\n   - Suggest provider/composition approach\n\n## Socialaize-Specific Search Patterns\n\nWhen analyzing components, use these search patterns:\n\n### Find Base Components\n```bash\nls src/components/vue/base/\n```\n\n### Find Animation Composables\n```bash\nls src/components/vue/animations/composables/\n```\n\n### Search for Variant Patterns\n```bash\ngrep -r \"defineProps<{.*variant\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n### Find Icon Usage\n```bash\ngrep -r \"@iconify/vue\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n### Find Animation Usage\n```bash\ngrep -r \"useAnimateElement\\|useMotion\" src/components/vue/\n```\n\n### Find Nanostore Usage\n```bash\ngrep -r \"extends BaseStore\" src/stores/\n```\n\n## Analysis Output Format\n\nProvide analysis in this structure:\n\n```markdown\n## 🎨 Design Analysis\n\n### Existing Patterns Found\n- [List similar components with file paths]\n- [Composition opportunities identified]\n\n### Design Tokens Required\n- **Colors**: List required tokens\n- **Spacing**: List spacing needs\n- **Typography**: List font/size needs\n- **Missing Tokens**: New tokens to add\n\n### Compliance Issues\n- ❌ Hardcoded values found: [list]\n- ❌ Inline styles detected: [list]\n- ✅ Token usage: [percentage]\n\n### Recommendations\n1. [Reuse existing component X]\n2. [Add tokens: --color-{name}]\n3. [Refactor to provider pattern]\n```\n\n## Enhanced Scoring Metrics\n\n### Depth Score (0-100)\n- Detects border usage vs shadow/color layering\n- Checks for dual-shadow systems\n- Validates elevation hierarchy\n\n**Calculation:**\n- -10 points per border (except inputs/focus)\n- +20 points for shadow usage\n- +10 points for color layering (bg-gray-50/100 pattern)\n- +10 points for consistent shadow scale\n\n### Typography Score (0-100)\n- Validates font size scale compliance\n- Checks font weight appropriateness\n- Verifies line-height rules\n- Checks color contrast ratios\n\n**Calculation:**\n- +25 points for consistent font scale\n- +25 points for appropriate weights\n- +25 points for correct line heights\n- +25 points for WCAG AA contrast\n\n### Motion Score (0-100)\n- Checks animation duration appropriateness\n- Validates easing functions\n- Ensures accessible motion (prefers-reduced-motion)\n\n**Calculation:**\n- +40 points for appropriate durations (150-300ms)\n- +30 points for correct easing (ease-out default)\n- +30 points for accessibility support\n\n### Interactive States Score (0-100)\n- Validates presence of all required states\n- Checks focus ring implementation\n- Validates disabled state implementation\n\n**Calculation:**\n- +20 points per required state present (hover, focus, active, disabled)\n- +10 points for proper focus rings\n- +10 points for consistent disabled pattern\n\n### Scoring Report Format\n\n```\n📊 Design Quality Analysis\n\nDepth Score: 85/100\n- ✅ Uses shadow-md for elevation\n- ✅ Color layering (bg-gray-50 → bg-white)\n- ⚠️  Found 2 borders (should use shadows)\n- Recommendation: Replace borders with shadows + color depth\n\nTypography Score: 95/100\n- ✅ Font scale compliance\n- ✅ Appropriate weights (semibold for headings)\n- ✅ WCAG AA contrast (7.2:1 headings, 5.1:1 body)\n- ⚠️  One instance of line-height: 1.3 in body text (should be 1.5)\n\nMotion Score: 80/100\n- ✅ Duration: 200ms (appropriate)\n- ⚠️  Missing ease-out (using default)\n- ⚠️  No prefers-reduced-motion support\n\nInteractive States Score: 90/100\n- ✅ Hover state implemented\n- ✅ Focus ring present (ring-2 ring-primary-500)\n- ✅ Active state (scale-95)\n- ✅ Disabled state (proper styling)\n- ⚠️  Loading state could be improved\n\nOverall Design Score: 87/100 ⭐ GOOD\n\nTop Priority Fixes:\n1. Add prefers-reduced-motion support\n2. Replace borders with shadows\n3. Fix body text line-height\n```\n\n## Design System Rules\n\n### ALWAYS Use:\n✅ CSS custom properties from design-system.css\n✅ Tailwind utility classes only\n✅ Computed classes for dynamic styling\n✅ Semantic token names (--color-primary, not --color-blue)\n\n### NEVER Use:\n❌ Hardcoded hex/rgb values\n❌ Inline style attributes\n❌ @apply directives\n❌ Custom px values not in design system\n\n## Token Naming Conventions\n\nFollow these patterns:\n- Colors: `--color-{semantic}-{shade}` (e.g., --color-primary-500)\n- Spacing: Use Tailwind scale (--spacing-4, --spacing-8)\n- Typography: `--font-{family}`, `--text-{size}`\n- Shadows: `--shadow-{size}`\n- Borders: `--border-{size}`\n- Radii: `--radius-{size}`\n\n## Search Strategy\n\n### Before Creating New Components:\n1. Search by functionality: `grep -r \"Button\" src/components/vue/`\n2. Search by pattern: `grep -r \"class.*btn\" src/components/vue/`\n3. Check ui/ and base/ directories first\n4. Look for provider patterns in config/\n\n### Composition Over Creation:\n- **Priority 1**: Reuse existing component\n- **Priority 2**: Compose from multiple components  \n- **Priority 3**: Extend base component\n- **Priority 4**: Create new only if justified\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\n- Limit initial context gathering to relevant files only\n- Use specific grep patterns for targeted searches\n- Focus on the most relevant 10-15 components\n- Don't read entire component directory at once\n\n## Communication Style\n\n- Be concise and actionable\n- Provide file paths for all references\n- Use bullet points for clarity\n- Include code examples when helpful\n- Flag critical issues immediately\n\n## Integration with Other Agents\n\n- **Feed to ui-builder**: Design tokens and patterns found\n- **Feed to ui-validator**: Compliance issues to check\n- **Feed to ui-documenter**: Token documentation needs\n\nYou work proactively - when you see requests for new components, AUTOMATICALLY analyze first before any code is written.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":7,"newStart":1,"newLines":7,"lines":[" ---"," name: ui-analyzer"," description: Use proactively for design analysis, token validation, and design-system.css management.

Text: 4.5:1 ratio minimum\n   - UI components: 3:1 ratio minimum\n\n## Performance Optimizations\n\n### When to Use:\n- `v-memo` for expensive computed lists\n- `v-once` for static content\n- `defineAsyncComponent` for heavy components\n- `computed()` instead of methods for derived state\n\n### Example:\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { computed, defineAsyncComponent } from 'vue'\n\n// Lazy load heavy component\nconst HeavyChart = defineAsyncComponent(() => \n  import('./HeavyChart.vue')\n)\n\n// Memoize expensive list rendering\nconst memoKey = computed(() => [items.value.length, sortOrder.value])\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <div v-for=\"item in items\" :key=\"item.id\" v-memo=\"memoKey\">\n    <!-- Expensive rendering -->\n  </div>\n</template>\n```\n\n## File Naming & Location\n\n### Naming Convention:\n- **PascalCase.vue** (e.g., PrimaryButton.vue, UserCard.vue)\n\n### Directory Structure:\n```\nsrc/components/vue/\n├── ui/              # Core design system components\n├── base/            # Foundation components\n├── buttons/         # Button variants\n├── cards/           # Card components\n├── modals/          # Dialogs/modals\n└── inputs/          # Form inputs\n```\n\n## Provider Pattern Integration\n\nFor platform-specific components, use provider pattern:\n\n```typescript\n// src/config/providers.ts\nexport const providers = {\n  facebook: {\n    name: 'Facebook',\n    icon: 'facebook',\n    color: '--color-facebook'\n  }\n  // ...\n}\n```\n\n```vue\n<!-- Use BaseProviderCard instead of FacebookCard -->\n<BaseProviderCard \n  platform=\"facebook\" \n  :account=\"accountData\" \n/>\n```\n\n## Testing Considerations\n\nGenerate components that are easily testable:\n- Pure functions for complex logic\n- Props for all inputs\n- Events for all outputs\n- No direct DOM manipulation\n\n## Refinement Process\n\nAfter initial generation:\n\n1. **Round 1 - Polish**:\n   - Review code quality\n   - Enhance TypeScript types\n   - Improve class naming\n   - Add code comments\n\n2. **Round 2 - Performance & A11y**:\n   - Add v-memo where needed\n   - Verify ARIA labels\n   - Check keyboard navigation\n   - Optimize computed properties\n\n## Communication Style\n\n- Provide clear explanations for variant differences\n- Show before/after comparisons when refactoring\n- Highlight key features and trade-offs\n- Be concise but complete\n- Use code examples liberally\n\n## Integration with Other Agents\n\n- **Receive from ui-analyzer**: Design tokens, patterns to follow\n- **Feed to ui-validator**: Generated code for quality checks\n- **Feed to ui-documenter**: Component details for documentation\n\n## Socialaize-Specific Patterns\n\n### ✅ ALWAYS Use:\n\n- Import Icon from '@iconify/vue' (NOT custom SVG components)\n- Import animations from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/'\n- Import constants from '@/constants/animations'\n- Use existing base components from '@/components/vue/base/'\n- Extend BaseStore for Appwrite collections\n- Use Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n### ❌ NEVER Use:\n\n- Custom icon components (use @iconify/vue)\n- Custom animation utilities (use existing system)\n- Pinia or Vuex (use Nanostore + BaseStore)\n- shadcn components (we use Headless UI)\n\n### Animation Pattern\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\nconst { animate } = useAnimateElement()\n\nconst handleClick = () => {\n  animate(element.value, 'fadeIn', {\n    duration: ANIMATION_DURATION.FAST,\n    easing: EASING.EASE_OUT\n  })\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n### Icon Pattern\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <!-- Material Design Icons -->\n  <Icon icon=\"mdi:check-circle\" class=\"w-5 h-5 text-success-500\" />\n\n  <!-- Simple Icons (brands) -->\n  <Icon icon=\"simple-icons:facebook\" class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n### Nanostore Integration\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useStore } from '@nanostores/vue'\nimport { userStore } from '@/stores/UserStore'\n\n// UserStore extends BaseStore<User>\nconst user = useStore(userStore.$user)\nconst isLoading = useStore(userStore.$isLoading)\n</script>\n```\n\n### Component Template (Socialaize Standard)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\nYou generate production-ready Vue 3 components following strict patterns and always provide 3 variant options.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":7,"newStart":1,"newLines":7,"lines":[" ---"," name: ui-builder"," description: Use for generating Vue 3 components with strict TypeScript, Composition API, and design system compliance.

Check keyboard navigation\n   - Optimize computed properties\n\n## Communication Style\n\n- Provide clear explanations for variant differences\n- Show before/after comparisons when refactoring\n- Highlight key features and trade-offs\n- Be concise but complete\n- Use code examples liberally\n\n## Integration with Other Agents\n\n- **Receive from ui-analyzer**: Design tokens, patterns to follow\n- **Feed to ui-validator**: Generated code for quality checks\n- **Feed to ui-documenter**: Component details for documentation\n\n## Socialaize-Specific Patterns\n\n### ✅ ALWAYS Use:\n\n- Import Icon from '@iconify/vue' (NOT custom SVG components)\n- Import animations from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/'\n- Import constants from '@/constants/animations'\n- Use existing base components from '@/components/vue/base/'\n- Extend BaseStore for Appwrite collections\n- Use Zod schemas matching Appwrite attributes\n\n### ❌ NEVER Use:\n\n- Custom icon components (use @iconify/vue)\n- Custom animation utilities (use existing system)\n- Pinia or Vuex (use Nanostore + BaseStore)\n- shadcn components (we use Headless UI)\n\n### Animation Pattern\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\nconst { animate } = useAnimateElement()\n\nconst handleClick = () => {\n  animate(element.value, 'fadeIn', {\n    duration: ANIMATION_DURATION.FAST,\n    easing: EASING.EASE_OUT\n  })\n}\n</script>\n```\n\n### Icon Pattern\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <!-- Material Design Icons -->\n  <Icon icon=\"mdi:check-circle\" class=\"w-5 h-5 text-success-500\" />\n\n  <!-- Simple Icons (brands) -->\n  <Icon icon=\"simple-icons:facebook\" class=\"w-5 h-5\" />\n</template>\n```\n\n### Nanostore Integration\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { useStore } from '@nanostores/vue'\nimport { userStore } from '@/stores/UserStore'\n\n// UserStore extends BaseStore<User>\nconst user = useStore(userStore.$user)\nconst isLoading = useStore(userStore.$isLoading)\n</script>\n```\n\n### Component Template (Socialaize Standard)\n\n```vue\n<script setup lang=\"ts\">\nimport { Icon } from '@iconify/vue'\nimport { useAnimateElement } from '@/components/vue/animations/composables/useAnimateElement'\nimport { ANIMATION_DURATION, EASING } from '@/constants/animations'\n\ninterface Props {\n  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'outline' | 'ghost'\n  size?: 'xs' | 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg' | 'xl'\n  loading?: boolean\n  disabled?: boolean\n}\n\nconst props = withDefaults(defineProps<Props>(), {\n  variant: 'primary',\n  size: 'md'\n})\n\nconst variantClasses = computed(() => ({\n  primary: 'bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white',\n  secondary: 'bg-secondary-500 hover:bg-secondary-600 text-white',\n  outline: 'border-2 border-primary-600 text-primary-700 hover:bg-primary-50',\n  ghost: 'text-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-50'\n}[props.variant]))\n\nconst sizeClasses = computed(() => ({\n  xs: 'px-2 py-1 text-xs',\n  sm: 'px-3 py-1.5 text-sm',\n  md: 'px-4 py-2 text-base',\n  lg: 'px-6 py-2.5 text-lg',\n  xl: 'px-8 py-3 text-xl'\n}[props.size]))\n</script>\n\n<template>\n  <button\n    :class=\"[\n      'btn-base',\n      variantClasses,\n      sizeClasses,\n      'focus-ring',\n      { 'opacity-60 cursor-not-allowed': disabled || loading }\n    ]\"\n    :disabled=\"disabled || loading\"\n  >\n    <Icon v-if=\"loading\" icon=\"mdi:loading\" class=\"animate-spin\" />\n    <slot />\n  </button>\n</template>\n```\n\nYou generate production-ready Vue 3 components following strict patterns and always provide 3 variant options.","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":15,"oldLines":8,"newStart":15,"newLines":19,"lines":[" "," You are a Vue 3 component generation expert specializing in Composition API, strict TypeScript, and production-ready code following the Socialaize design system."," ","-**Tools:** write, edit (component creation) -
