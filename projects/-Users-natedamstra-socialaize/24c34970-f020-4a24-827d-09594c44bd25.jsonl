Does NotebookLM have an official API for programmatic access?\n\nYes, but it is exclusively for **NotebookLM Enterprise**, which is part of the Google Cloud ecosystem. The standard, consumer version of NotebookLM does **not** have an official public API. Access to the Enterprise API requires a Google Cloud project with the Vertex AI Agent Builder API enabled.\n\n### 2. Can you export/import documents to NotebookLM programmatically?\n\nYes, with the **NotebookLM Enterprise API**, you can manage notebooks programmatically. This includes creating, retrieving, listing, deleting, and sharing notebooks, which is the primary method for managing your source documents.\n\nFor the personal version, this is only possible through unofficial methods.\n\n### 3. Can you query NotebookLM and get responses back via API?\n\nThe **NotebookLM Enterprise API**, as part of its integration with Google's Agent Builder, is designed for building conversational AI applications, which includes querying grounded sources.

Collect all relevant project docs (MD, code files)\n# 2. Send to Gemini with @file syntax (handles 2M tokens)\n# 3. Ask specific questions about codebase\n# 4. Store insights in NATE_SECOND_BRAIN for future reference\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ Uses existing, supported tools\n- ✅ 2M token context window (massive)\n- ✅ Can include web search in analysis\n- ✅ No browser automation brittleness\n- ✅ Integrates with NATE_SECOND_BRAIN\n\n### Option B: NATE_SECOND_BRAIN RAG Enhancement\n\nEnhance existing knowledge system with chat interface:\n\n**Phase 1: Vector Search Integration**\n- Add LanceDB vector embeddings (already planned)\n- Semantic search over extracted insights\n- Hybrid text + vector search\n\n**Phase 2: Chat Interface Over Knowledge Base**\n```bash\n# /knowledge-chat [question]\n# 1. Query NATE_SECOND_BRAIN with hybrid search\n# 2. Retrieve relevant insights (text + vector)\n# 3. Use Claude/Gemini to synthesize answer\n# 4.

Browser Automation (Most Practical)**\n- Use Playwright/Selenium to automate NotebookLM web UI\n- Can upload documents programmatically\n- Can submit queries and extract responses\n- **Downside**: Brittle, breaks when UI changes\n\n**2. NotebookLM Enterprise** (Paid)\n- Full Vertex AI Agent Builder API access\n- Complete programmatic control\n- Requires Google Cloud subscription\n\n**3. Self-Hosted Alternatives**\n- **Open Notebook**: Open-source NotebookLM clone with REST API\n- Full API control but requires self-hosting\n\n### Proposed Integration Architecture\n\n```\nClaude Code\n    ↓ (export docs)\nPlaywright Browser Automation\n    ↓ (upload files)\nNotebookLM Web UI\n    ↑ (extract responses)\nPlaywright Browser Automation\n    ↑ (return answers)\nClaude Code\n```\n\n#### Custom Slash Commands (Potential)\n\n```bash\n# /notebooklm-export\n# Collects docs from codebase (markdown, code files)\n# Uses Playwright to upload to NotebookLM\n# Stores NotebookLM notebook ID for later queries\n\n# /notebooklm-ask <question>\n# Uses Playwright to navigate to notebook\n# Submits question via automated browser\n# Extracts response and returns to Claude\n```\n\n## Analysis: Do We Need NotebookLM Integration?\n\n### Redundant Capabilities\n\n**We Already Have:**\n\n1. **Gemini CLI MCP** (Same Model as NotebookLM)\n   - NotebookLM uses Gemini 1.5 Pro under the hood\n   - Our Gemini MCP handles 2M+ token contexts\n   - Can analyze multiple files with `@file` syntax\n   - Supports web search during analysis\n\n2. **NATE_SECOND_BRAIN** (Knowledge Management)\n   - Extract insights from planning docs\n   - Full-text search (SQLite FTS5)\n   - Vector search capability (planned with LanceDB)\n   - Persistent knowledge across sessions\n\n3. **Firecrawl MCP** (Documentation Scraping)\n   - Scrape external documentation\n   - Search and extract structured data\n   - Cache for fast repeated access\n\n### NotebookLM's Unique Value\n- **Audio Overviews**: Generate podcast-style summaries (no API access)\n- **Different AI Perspective**: Sometimes helpful to get multiple model views\n- **UI-Optimized Experience**: Great for manual research, not automation\n\n### Recommendation: Don't Build NotebookLM Integration\n\n**Reasons:**\n1. **High Maintenance Burden**: Browser automation is brittle\n2. **Redundant Functionality**: Gemini MCP provides same capabilities\n3. **No Official API**: Consumer version unsupported for automation\n4. **Better Alternatives Exist**: See below\n\n## Recommended Alternatives\n\n### Option A: Enhanced Gemini Workflow (RECOMMENDED)\n\nCreate a new slash command that leverages existing Gemini MCP:\n\n```bash\n# /analyze-codebase-with-gemini [query]\n# 1. Collect all relevant project docs (MD, code files)\n# 2. Send to Gemini with @file syntax (handles 2M tokens)\n# 3. Ask specific questions about codebase\n# 4. Store insights in NATE_SECOND_BRAIN for future reference\n```\n\n**Benefits:**\n- ✅ Uses existing, supported tools\n- ✅ 2M token context window (massive)\n- ✅ Can include web search in analysis\n- ✅ No browser automation brittleness\n- ✅ Integrates with NATE_SECOND_BRAIN\n\n### Option B: NATE_SECOND_BRAIN RAG Enhancement\n\nEnhance existing knowledge system with chat interface:\n\n**Phase 1: Vector Search Integration**\n- Add LanceDB vector embeddings (already planned)\n- Semantic search over extracted insights\n- Hybrid text + vector search\n\n**Phase 2: Chat Interface Over Knowledge Base**\n```bash\n# /knowledge-chat [question]\n# 1. Query NATE_SECOND_BRAIN with hybrid search\n# 2. Retrieve relevant insights (text + vector)\n# 3. Use Claude/Gemini to synthesize answer\n# 4.
