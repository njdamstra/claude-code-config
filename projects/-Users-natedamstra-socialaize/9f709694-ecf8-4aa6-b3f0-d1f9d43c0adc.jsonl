Here's a strategy to preserve your scraped data:\n\n1. **Save the scraped content to files first** - Before running `/compact`, write all the important scraped content to temporary files:\n\n```bash\n# Create a temp directory for scraped data\nmkdir -p .temp/scraped-data\n```\n\nThen use the Write tool to save each scraped page's content to individual files:\n- `.temp/scraped-data/page1.md`\n- `.temp/scraped-data/page2.md`\n- etc.\n\n2. **Run `/compact`** - This will reduce your context size\n\n3. **Process the saved files** - After compacting, read from the saved files and add their content to your documents\n\nThis approach ensures:\n- ✅ No data loss from compaction\n- ✅ No need to re-scrape (avoids rate limits)\n- ✅ Clean context management\n- ✅ Files can be `.gitignore`d if temporary\n\nWould you like me to help you save the scraped content to files?
