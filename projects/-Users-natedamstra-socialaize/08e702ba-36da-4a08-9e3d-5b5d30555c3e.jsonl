This means that you have submitted too many tokens or requests in a short period of time and have exceeded the number of requests allowed. This could happen for several reasons, such as:\\n\\n- You are using a loop or a script that makes frequent or concurrent requests.\\n- You are sharing your API key with other users or applications.\\n- You are using a free plan that has a low rate limit.\\n- You have reached the defined limit on your project\\n\\nTo resolve this error, please follow these steps:\\n\\n- Pace your requests and avoid making unnecessary or redundant calls.\\n- If you are using a loop or a script, make sure to implement a backoff mechanism or a retry logic that respects the rate limit and the response headers. You can read more about our rate limiting policy and best practices in our [rate limit guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).\\n- If you are sharing your organization with other users, note that limits are applied per organization and not per user. It is worth checking on the usage of the rest of your team as this will contribute to the limit.\\n- If you are using a free or low-tier plan, consider upgrading to a pay-as-you-go plan that offers a higher rate limit. You can compare the restrictions of each plan in our [rate limit guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).\\n- Reach out to your organization owner to increase the rate limits on your project\\n\\n429 - You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details\\n\\nThis error message indicates that you hit your monthly [usage limit](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) for the API, or for prepaid credits customers that you've consumed all your credits. You can view your maximum usage limit on the [limits page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits). This could happen for several reasons, such as:\\n\\n- You are using a high-volume or complex service that consumes a lot of credits or tokens.\\n- Your monthly budget is set too low for your organization’s usage.\\n- Your monthly budget is set too low for your project's usage.\\n\\nTo resolve this error, please follow these steps:\\n\\n- Check your [current usage](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage) of your account, and compare that to your account's [limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).\\n- If you are on a free plan, consider [upgrading to a paid plan](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing) to get higher limits.\\n- Reach out to your organization owner to increase the budgets for your project.\\n\\n503 - The engine is currently overloaded, please try again later\\n\\nThis error message indicates that our servers are experiencing high traffic and are unable to process your request at the moment.

By setting rate limits, OpenAI can prevent this kind of activity.\\n- **Rate limits help ensure that everyone has fair access to the API.** If one person or organization makes an excessive number of requests, it could bog down the API for everyone else. By throttling the number of requests that a single user can make, OpenAI ensures that the most number of people have an opportunity to use the API without experiencing slowdowns.\\n- **Rate limits can help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure.** If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users.\\n\\nPlease work through this document in its entirety to better understand how OpenAI’s rate limit system works. We include code examples and possible solutions to handle common issues. We also include details around how your rate limits are automatically increased in the usage tiers section below.\\n\\n## How do these rate limits work?\\n\\nRate limits are measured in five ways: **RPM** (requests per minute), **RPD** (requests per day), **TPM** (tokens per minute), **TPD** (tokens per day), and **IPM** (images per minute). Rate limits can be hit across any of the options depending on what occurs first. For example, you might send 20 requests with only 100 tokens to the ChatCompletions endpoint and that would fill your limit (if your RPM was 20), even if you did not send 150k tokens (if your TPM limit was 150k) within those 20 requests.\\n\\n[Batch API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch/create) queue limits are calculated based on the total number of input tokens queued for a given model. Tokens from pending batch jobs are counted against your queue limit. Once a batch job is completed, its tokens are no longer counted against that model's limit.\\n\\nOther important things worth noting:\\n\\n- Rate limits are defined at the [organization level](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/production-best-practices) and at the project level, not user level.\\n- Rate limits vary by the [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) being used.\\n- For long context models like GPT-4.1, there is a separate rate limit for long context requests. You can view these rate limits in [developer console](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).\\n- Limits are also placed on the total amount an organization can spend on the API each month. These are also known as \\\"usage limits\\\".\\n- Some model families have shared rate limits. Any models listed under a \\\"shared limit\\\" in your [organizations limit page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) share a rate limit between them. For example, if the listed shared TPM is 3.5M, all calls to any model in the given \\\"shared limit\\\" list will count towards that 3.5M.\\n\\n## Usage tiers\\n\\nYou can view the rate and usage limits for your organization under the [limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) section of your account settings. As your spend on our API goes up, we automatically graduate you to the next usage tier. This usually results in an increase in rate limits across most models.\\n\\n| Tier | Qualification | Usage limits |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Free | User must be in an [allowed geography](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries) | $100 / month |\\n| Tier 1 | $5 paid | $100 / month |\\n| Tier 2 | $50 paid and 7+ days since first successful payment | $500 / month |\\n| Tier 3 | $100 paid and 7+ days since first successful payment | $1,000 / month |\\n| Tier 4 | $250 paid and 14+ days since first successful payment | $5,000 / month |\\n| Tier 5 | $1,000 paid and 30+ days since first successful payment | $200,000 / month |\\n\\nTo view a high-level summary of rate limits per model, visit the [models page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).\\n\\n### Rate limits in headers\\n\\nIn addition to seeing your rate limit on your [account page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits), you can also view important information about your rate limits such as the remaining requests, tokens, and other metadata in the headers of the HTTP response.\\n\\nYou can expect to see the following header fields:\\n\\n| Field | Sample Value | Description |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| x-ratelimit-limit-requests | 60 | The maximum number of requests that are permitted before exhausting the rate limit. |\\n| x-ratelimit-limit-tokens | 150000 | The maximum number of tokens that are permitted before exhausting the rate limit. |\\n| x-ratelimit-remaining-requests | 59 | The remaining number of requests that are permitted before exhausting the rate limit. |\\n| x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens | 149984 | The remaining number of tokens that are permitted before exhausting the rate limit. |\\n| x-ratelimit-reset-requests | 1s | The time until the rate limit (based on requests) resets to its initial state. |\\n| x-ratelimit-reset-tokens | 6m0s | The time until the rate limit (based on tokens) resets to its initial state. |\\n\\n### Fine-tuning rate limits\\n\\nThe fine-tuning rate limits for your organization can be [found in the dashboard as well](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits), and can also be retrieved via API:\\n\\n```bash\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/model_limits \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Error mitigation\\n\\n### What are some steps I can take to mitigate this?\\n\\nThe OpenAI Cookbook has a [Python notebook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_handle_rate_limits) that explains how to avoid rate limit errors, as well an example [Python script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/api_request_parallel_processor.py) for staying under rate limits while batch processing API requests.\\n\\nYou should also exercise caution when providing programmatic access, bulk processing features, and automated social media posting - consider only enabling these for trusted customers.\\n\\nTo protect against automated and high-volume misuse, set a usage limit for individual users within a specified time frame (daily, weekly, or monthly). Consider implementing a hard cap or a manual review process for users who exceed the limit.\\n\\n#### Retrying with exponential backoff\\n\\nOne easy way to avoid rate limit errors is to automatically retry requests with a random exponential backoff. Retrying with exponential backoff means performing a short sleep when a rate limit error is hit, then retrying the unsuccessful request. If the request is still unsuccessful, the sleep length is increased and the process is repeated. This continues until the request is successful or until a maximum number of retries is reached.\\nThis approach has many benefits:\\n\\n- Automatic retries means you can recover from rate limit errors without crashes or missing data\\n- Exponential backoff means that your first retries can be tried quickly, while still benefiting from longer delays if your first few retries fail\\n- Adding random jitter to the delay helps retries from all hitting at the same time.\\n\\nNote that unsuccessful requests contribute to your per-minute limit, so continuously resending a request won’t work.\\n\\nBelow are a few example solutions **for Python** that use exponential backoff.\\n\\nExample 1: Using the Tenacity library\\n\\nTenacity is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library, written in Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything.\\nTo add exponential backoff to your requests, you can use the `tenacity.retry` decorator. The below example uses the `tenacity.wait_random_exponential` function to add random exponential backoff to a request.\\n\\nUsing the Tenacity library\\n\\npython\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nfrom tenacity import (\\n    retry,\\n    stop_after_attempt,\\n    wait_random_exponential,\\n)  # for exponential backoff\\n\\n@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(6))\\ndef completion_with_backoff(**kwargs):\\n    return client.completions.create(**kwargs)\\n\\ncompletion_with_backoff(model=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\", prompt=\\\"Once upon a time,\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNote that the Tenacity library is a third-party tool, and OpenAI makes no guarantees about\\nits reliability or security.\\n\\nExample 2: Using the backoff library\\n\\nAnother python library that provides function decorators for backoff and retry is [backoff](https://pypi.org/project/backoff/):\\n\\nUsing the Tenacity library\\n\\npython\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nimport backoff\\nimport openai\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\n@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, openai.RateLimitError)\\ndef completions_with_backoff(**kwargs):\\n    return client.completions.create(**kwargs)\\n\\ncompletions_with_backoff(model=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\", prompt=\\\"Once upon a time,\\\")\\n```\\n\\nLike Tenacity, the backoff library is a third-party tool, and OpenAI makes no guarantees about its reliability or security.\\n\\nExample 3: Manual backoff implementation\\n\\nIf you don't want to use third-party libraries, you can implement your own backoff logic following this example:\\n\\nUsing manual backoff implementation\\n\\npython\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\n46\\n47\\n48\\n49\\n50\\n51\\n52\\n53\\n54\\n55\\n# imports\\nimport random\\nimport time\\n\\nimport openai\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\n# define a retry decorator\\ndef retry_with_exponential_backoff(\\n    func,\\n    initial_delay: float = 1,\\n    exponential_base: float = 2,\\n    jitter: bool = True,\\n    max_retries: int = 10,\\n    errors: tuple = (openai.RateLimitError,),\\n):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Retry a function with exponential backoff.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\\n        # Initialize variables\\n        num_retries = 0\\n        delay = initial_delay\\n\\n        # Loop until a successful response or max_retries is hit or an exception is raised\\n        while True:\\n            try:\\n                return func(*args, **kwargs)\\n\\n            # Retry on specific errors\\n            except errors as e:\\n                # Increment retries\\n                num_retries += 1\\n\\n                # Check if max retries has been reached\\n                if num_retries > max_retries:\\n                    raise Exception(\\n                        f\\\"Maximum number of retries ({max_retries}) exceeded.\\\"\\n                    )\\n\\n                # Increment the delay\\n                delay *= exponential_base * (1 + jitter * random.random())\\n\\n                # Sleep for the delay\\n                time.sleep(delay)\\n\\n            # Raise exceptions for any errors not specified\\n            except Exception as e:\\n                raise e\\n\\n    return wrapper\\n\\n@retry_with_exponential_backoff\\ndef completions_with_backoff(**kwargs):\\n    return client.completions.create(**kwargs)\\n```\\n\\nAgain, OpenAI makes no guarantees on the security or efficiency of this solution but it can be a good starting place for your own solution.\\n\\n#### Reduce the `max_tokens` to match the size of your completions\\n\\nYour rate limit is calculated as the maximum of `max_tokens` and the estimated number of tokens based on the character count of your request. Try to set the `max_tokens` value as close to your expected response size as possible.\\n\\n#### Batching requests\\n\\nIf your use case does not require immediate responses, you can use the [Batch API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch) to more easily submit and execute large collections of requests without impacting your synchronous request rate limits.\\n\\nFor use cases that _do_ requires synchronous responses, the OpenAI API has separate limits for **requests per minute** and **tokens per minute**.\\n\\nIf you're hitting the limit on requests per minute but have available capacity on tokens per minute, you can increase your throughput by batching multiple tasks into each request. This will allow you to process more tokens per minute, especially with our smaller models.\\n\\nSending in a batch of prompts works exactly the same as a normal API call, except you pass in a list of strings to the prompt parameter instead of a single string.

The below example uses the `tenacity.wait_random_exponential` function to add random exponential backoff to a request.\\n\\nUsing the Tenacity library\\n\\npython\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nfrom tenacity import (\\n    retry,\\n    stop_after_attempt,\\n    wait_random_exponential,\\n)  # for exponential backoff\\n\\n@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(6))\\ndef completion_with_backoff(**kwargs):\\n    return client.completions.create(**kwargs)\\n\\ncompletion_with_backoff(model=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\", prompt=\\\"Once upon a time,\\\")\\n```\\n\\nNote that the Tenacity library is a third-party tool, and OpenAI makes no guarantees about\\nits reliability or security.\\n\\nExample 2: Using the backoff library\\n\\nAnother python library that provides function decorators for backoff and retry is [backoff](https://pypi.org/project/backoff/):\\n\\nUsing the Tenacity library\\n\\npython\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nimport backoff\\nimport openai\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\n@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, openai.RateLimitError)\\ndef completions_with_backoff(**kwargs):\\n    return client.completions.create(**kwargs)\\n\\ncompletions_with_backoff(model=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\", prompt=\\\"Once upon a time,\\\")\\n```\\n\\nLike Tenacity, the backoff library is a third-party tool, and OpenAI makes no guarantees about its reliability or security.\\n\\nExample 3: Manual backoff implementation\\n\\nIf you don't want to use third-party libraries, you can implement your own backoff logic following this example:\\n\\nUsing manual backoff implementation\\n\\npython\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\n26\\n27\\n28\\n29\\n30\\n31\\n32\\n33\\n34\\n35\\n36\\n37\\n38\\n39\\n40\\n41\\n42\\n43\\n44\\n45\\n46\\n47\\n48\\n49\\n50\\n51\\n52\\n53\\n54\\n55\\n# imports\\nimport random\\nimport time\\n\\nimport openai\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\n# define a retry decorator\\ndef retry_with_exponential_backoff(\\n    func,\\n    initial_delay: float = 1,\\n    exponential_base: float = 2,\\n    jitter: bool = True,\\n    max_retries: int = 10,\\n    errors: tuple = (openai.RateLimitError,),\\n):\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Retry a function with exponential backoff.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\\n        # Initialize variables\\n        num_retries = 0\\n        delay = initial_delay\\n\\n        # Loop until a successful response or max_retries is hit or an exception is raised\\n        while True:\\n            try:\\n                return func(*args, **kwargs)\\n\\n            # Retry on specific errors\\n            except errors as e:\\n                # Increment retries\\n                num_retries += 1\\n\\n                # Check if max retries has been reached\\n                if num_retries > max_retries:\\n                    raise Exception(\\n                        f\\\"Maximum number of retries ({max_retries}) exceeded.\\\"\\n                    )\\n\\n                # Increment the delay\\n                delay *= exponential_base * (1 + jitter * random.random())\\n\\n                # Sleep for the delay\\n                time.sleep(delay)\\n\\n            # Raise exceptions for any errors not specified\\n            except Exception as e:\\n                raise e\\n\\n    return wrapper\\n\\n@retry_with_exponential_backoff\\ndef completions_with_backoff(**kwargs):\\n    return client.completions.create(**kwargs)\\n```\\n\\nAgain, OpenAI makes no guarantees on the security or efficiency of this solution but it can be a good starting place for your own solution.\\n\\n#### Reduce the `max_tokens` to match the size of your completions\\n\\nYour rate limit is calculated as the maximum of `max_tokens` and the estimated number of tokens based on the character count of your request. Try to set the `max_tokens` value as close to your expected response size as possible.\\n\\n#### Batching requests\\n\\nIf your use case does not require immediate responses, you can use the [Batch API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch) to more easily submit and execute large collections of requests without impacting your synchronous request rate limits.\\n\\nFor use cases that _do_ requires synchronous responses, the OpenAI API has separate limits for **requests per minute** and **tokens per minute**.\\n\\nIf you're hitting the limit on requests per minute but have available capacity on tokens per minute, you can increase your throughput by batching multiple tasks into each request. This will allow you to process more tokens per minute, especially with our smaller models.\\n\\nSending in a batch of prompts works exactly the same as a normal API call, except you pass in a list of strings to the prompt parameter instead of a single string.

Please try again later.\\n\\n[Watch on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGJNo8TpuVA&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fplatform.openai.com%2F)\\n\\n0:00\\n\\n0:00 / 34:10\\n•Live\\n\\n•\\n\\n## Setting up your organization\\n\\nOnce you [log in](https://platform.openai.com/login) to your OpenAI account, you can find your organization name and ID in your [organization settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/general). The organization name is the label for your organization, shown in user interfaces. The organization ID is the unique identifier for your organization which can be used in API requests.\\n\\nUsers who belong to multiple organizations can [pass a header](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/requesting-organization) to specify which organization is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count against the specified organization's quota. If no header is provided, the [default organization](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) will be billed. You can change your default organization in your [user settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).\\n\\nYou can invite new members to your organization from the [Team page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/team). Members can be **readers** or **owners**.\\n\\nReaders:\\n\\n- Can make API requests.\\n- Can view basic organization information.\\n- Can create, update, and delete resources (like Assistants) in the organization, unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nOwners:\\n\\n- Have all the permissions of readers.\\n- Can modify billing information.\\n- Can manage members within the organization.\\n\\n### Managing billing limits\\n\\nOnce you’ve entered your billing information, you will have an approved usage limit of $100 per month, which is set by OpenAI. Your quota limit will automatically increase as your usage on your platform increases and you move from one [usage tier](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits#usage-tiers) to another. You can review your current usage limit in the [limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page in your account settings.\\n\\nIf you’d like to be notified when your usage exceeds a certain dollar amount, you can set a notification threshold through the [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page.\\n\\n### API keys\\n\\nThe OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.\\n\\nThis is a relatively straightforward way to control access, but you must be vigilant about securing these keys. Avoid exposing the API keys in your code or in public repositories; instead, store them in a secure location. You should expose your keys to your application using environment variables or secret management service, so that you don't need to hard-code them in your codebase. Read more in our [Best practices for API key safety](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).\\n\\nAPI key usage can be monitored on the [Usage page](https://platform.openai.com/usage) once tracking is enabled. If you are using an API key generated prior to Dec 20, 2023 tracking will not be enabled by default. You can enable tracking going forward on the [API key management dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). All API keys generated past Dec 20, 2023 have tracking enabled. Any previous untracked usage will be displayed as `Untracked` in the dashboard.\\n\\n### Staging projects\\n\\nAs you scale, you may want to create separate projects for your staging and production environments. You can create these projects in the dashboard, allowing you to isolate your development and testing work, so you don't accidentally disrupt your live application. You can also limit user access to your production project, and set custom rate and spend limits per project.\\n\\n## Scaling your solution architecture\\n\\nWhen designing your application or service for production that uses our API, it's important to consider how you will scale to meet traffic demands. There are a few key areas you will need to consider regardless of the cloud service provider of your choice:\\n\\n- **Horizontal scaling**: You may want to scale your application out horizontally to accommodate requests to your application that come from multiple sources. This could involve deploying additional servers or containers to distribute the load. If you opt for this type of scaling, make sure that your architecture is designed to handle multiple nodes and that you have mechanisms in place to balance the load between them.\\n- **Vertical scaling**: Another option is to scale your application up vertically, meaning you can beef up the resources available to a single node. This would involve upgrading your server's capabilities to handle the additional load. If you opt for this type of scaling, make sure your application is designed to take advantage of these additional resources.\\n- **Caching**: By storing frequently accessed data, you can improve response times without needing to make repeated calls to our API. Your application will need to be designed to use cached data whenever possible and invalidate the cache when new information is added. There are a few different ways you could do this. For example, you could store data in a database, filesystem, or in-memory cache, depending on what makes the most sense for your application.\\n- **Load balancing**: Finally, consider load-balancing techniques to ensure requests are distributed evenly across your available servers. This could involve using a load balancer in front of your servers or using DNS round-robin. Balancing the load will help improve performance and reduce bottlenecks.\\n\\n### Managing rate limits\\n\\nWhen using our API, it's important to understand and plan for [rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).\\n\\n## Improving latencies\\n\\nCheck out our most up-to-date guide on [latency optimization](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/latency-optimization).\\n\\nLatency is the time it takes for a request to be processed and a response to be returned. In this section, we will discuss some factors that influence the latency of our text generation models and provide suggestions on how to reduce it.\\n\\nThe latency of a completion request is mostly influenced by two factors: the model and the number of tokens generated. The life cycle of a completion request looks like this:\\n\\nNetwork\\n\\nEnd user to API latency\\n\\nServer\\n\\nTime to process prompt tokens\\n\\nServer\\n\\nTime to sample/generate tokens\\n\\nNetwork\\n\\nAPI to end user latency\\n\\nThe bulk of the latency typically arises from the token generation step.\\n\\n> **Intuition**: Prompt tokens add very little latency to completion calls. Time to generate completion tokens is much longer, as tokens are generated one at a time. Longer generation lengths will accumulate latency due to generation required for each token.\\n\\n### Common factors affecting latency and possible mitigation techniques\\n\\nNow that we have looked at the basics of latency, let’s take a look at various factors that can affect latency, broadly ordered from most impactful to least impactful.\\n\\n#### Model\\n\\nOur API offers different models with varying levels of complexity and generality. The most capable models, such as `gpt-4`, can generate more complex and diverse completions, but they also take longer to process your query.\\nModels such as `gpt-4o-mini`, can generate faster and cheaper Chat Completions, but they may generate results that are less accurate or relevant for your query. You can choose the model that best suits your use case and the trade-off between speed, cost, and quality.\\n\\n#### Number of completion tokens\\n\\nRequesting a large amount of generated tokens completions can lead to increased latencies:\\n\\n- **Lower max tokens**: for requests with a similar token generation count, those that have a lower `max_tokens` parameter incur less latency.\\n- **Include stop sequences**: to prevent generating unneeded tokens, add a stop sequence. For example, you can use stop sequences to generate a list with a specific number of items. In this case, by using `11.` as a stop sequence, you can generate a list with only 10 items, since the completion will stop when `11.` is reached. [Read our help article on stop sequences](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5072263-how-do-i-use-stop-sequences) for more context on how you can do this.\\n- **Generate fewer completions**: lower the values of `n` and `best_of` when possible where `n` refers to how many completions to generate for each prompt and `best_of` is used to represent the result with the highest log probability per token.\\n\\nIf `n` and `best_of` both equal 1 (which is the default), the number of generated tokens will be at most, equal to `max_tokens`.\\n\\nIf `n` (the number of completions returned) or `best_of` (the number of completions generated for consideration) are set to `> 1`, each request will create multiple outputs. Here, you can consider the number of generated tokens as `[ max_tokens * max (n, best_of) ]`\\n\\n#### Streaming\\n\\nSetting `stream: true` in a request makes the model start returning tokens as soon as they are available, instead of waiting for the full sequence of tokens to be generated. It does not change the time to get all the tokens, but it reduces the time for first token for an application where we want to show partial progress or are going to stop generations. This can be a better user experience and a UX improvement so it’s worth experimenting with streaming.\\n\\n#### Infrastructure\\n\\nOur servers are currently located in the US. While we hope to have global redundancy in the future, in the meantime you could consider locating the relevant parts of your infrastructure in the US to minimize the roundtrip time between your servers and the OpenAI servers.\\n\\n#### Batching\\n\\nDepending on your use case, batching _may help_. If you are sending multiple requests to the same endpoint, you can [batch the prompts](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits#batching-requests) to be sent in the same request. This will reduce the number of requests you need to make. The prompt parameter can hold up to 20 unique prompts. We advise you to test out this method and see if it helps. In some cases, you may end up increasing the number of generated tokens which will slow the response time.\\n\\n## Managing costs\\n\\nTo monitor your costs, you can set a [notification threshold](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) in your account to receive an email alert once you pass a certain usage threshold. You can also set a [monthly budget](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits). Please be mindful of the potential for a monthly budget to cause disruptions to your application/users. Use the [usage tracking dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage) to monitor your token usage during the current and past billing cycles.\\n\\n### Text generation\\n\\nOne of the challenges of moving your prototype into production is budgeting for the costs associated with running your application. OpenAI offers a [pay-as-you-go pricing model](https://openai.com/api/pricing/), with prices per 1,000 tokens (roughly equal to 750 words). To estimate your costs, you will need to project the token utilization. Consider factors such as traffic levels, the frequency with which users will interact with your application, and the amount of data you will be processing.\\n\\n**One useful framework for thinking about reducing costs is to consider costs as a function of the number of tokens and the cost per token.** There are two potential avenues for reducing costs using this framework. First, you could work to reduce the cost per token by switching to smaller models for some tasks in order to reduce costs. Alternatively, you could try to reduce the number of tokens required. There are a few ways you could do this, such as by using shorter prompts, [fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization) models, or caching common user queries so that they don't need to be processed repeatedly.\\n\\nYou can experiment with our interactive [tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to help you estimate costs. The API and playground also returns token counts as part of the response. Once you’ve got things working with our most capable model, you can see if the other models can produce the same results with lower latency and costs. Learn more in our [token usage help article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6614209-how-do-i-check-my-token-usage).\\n\\n## MLOps strategy\\n\\nAs you move your prototype into production, you may want to consider developing an MLOps strategy. MLOps (machine learning operations) refers to the process of managing the end-to-end life cycle of your machine learning models, including any models you may be fine-tuning using our API. There are a number of areas to consider when designing your MLOps strategy. These include\\n\\n- Data and model management: managing the data used to train or fine-tune your model and tracking versions and changes.\\n- Model monitoring: tracking your model's performance over time and detecting any potential issues or degradation.\\n- Model retraining: ensuring your model stays up to date with changes in data or evolving requirements and retraining or fine-tuning it as needed.\\n- Model deployment: automating the process of deploying your model and related artifacts into production.\\n\\nThinking through these aspects of your application will help ensure your model stays relevant and performs well over time.\\n\\n## Security and compliance\\n\\nAs you move your prototype into production, you will need to assess and address any security and compliance requirements that may apply to your application. This will involve examining the data you are handling, understanding how our API processes data, and determining what regulations you must adhere to. Our [security practices](https://www.openai.com/security) and [trust and compliance portal](https://trust.openai.com/) provide our most comprehensive and up-to-date documentation. For reference, here is our [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/api/policies/terms/).\\n\\nSome common areas you'll need to consider include data storage, data transmission, and data retention. You might also need to implement data privacy protections, such as encryption or anonymization where possible. In addition, you should follow best practices for secure coding, such as input sanitization and proper error handling.\\n\\n### Safety best practices\\n\\nWhen creating your application with our API, consider our [safety best practices](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices) to ensure your application is safe and successful. These recommendations highlight the importance of testing the product extensively, being proactive about addressing potential issues, and limiting opportunities for misuse.\\n\\n## Business considerations\\n\\nAs projects using AI move from prototype to production, it is important to consider how to build a great product with AI and how that ties back to your core business.

The organization name is the label for your organization, shown in user interfaces. The organization ID is the unique identifier for your organization which can be used in API requests.\\n\\nUsers who belong to multiple organizations can [pass a header](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/requesting-organization) to specify which organization is used for an API request. Usage from these API requests will count against the specified organization's quota. If no header is provided, the [default organization](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) will be billed. You can change your default organization in your [user settings](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys).\\n\\nYou can invite new members to your organization from the [Team page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/team). Members can be **readers** or **owners**.\\n\\nReaders:\\n\\n- Can make API requests.\\n- Can view basic organization information.\\n- Can create, update, and delete resources (like Assistants) in the organization, unless otherwise noted.\\n\\nOwners:\\n\\n- Have all the permissions of readers.\\n- Can modify billing information.\\n- Can manage members within the organization.\\n\\n### Managing billing limits\\n\\nOnce you’ve entered your billing information, you will have an approved usage limit of $100 per month, which is set by OpenAI. Your quota limit will automatically increase as your usage on your platform increases and you move from one [usage tier](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits#usage-tiers) to another. You can review your current usage limit in the [limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page in your account settings.\\n\\nIf you’d like to be notified when your usage exceeds a certain dollar amount, you can set a notification threshold through the [usage limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) page.\\n\\n### API keys\\n\\nThe OpenAI API uses API keys for authentication. Visit your [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) page to retrieve the API key you'll use in your requests.\\n\\nThis is a relatively straightforward way to control access, but you must be vigilant about securing these keys. Avoid exposing the API keys in your code or in public repositories; instead, store them in a secure location. You should expose your keys to your application using environment variables or secret management service, so that you don't need to hard-code them in your codebase. Read more in our [Best practices for API key safety](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety).\\n\\nAPI key usage can be monitored on the [Usage page](https://platform.openai.com/usage) once tracking is enabled. If you are using an API key generated prior to Dec 20, 2023 tracking will not be enabled by default. You can enable tracking going forward on the [API key management dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). All API keys generated past Dec 20, 2023 have tracking enabled. Any previous untracked usage will be displayed as `Untracked` in the dashboard.\\n\\n### Staging projects\\n\\nAs you scale, you may want to create separate projects for your staging and production environments. You can create these projects in the dashboard, allowing you to isolate your development and testing work, so you don't accidentally disrupt your live application. You can also limit user access to your production project, and set custom rate and spend limits per project.\\n\\n## Scaling your solution architecture\\n\\nWhen designing your application or service for production that uses our API, it's important to consider how you will scale to meet traffic demands. There are a few key areas you will need to consider regardless of the cloud service provider of your choice:\\n\\n- **Horizontal scaling**: You may want to scale your application out horizontally to accommodate requests to your application that come from multiple sources. This could involve deploying additional servers or containers to distribute the load. If you opt for this type of scaling, make sure that your architecture is designed to handle multiple nodes and that you have mechanisms in place to balance the load between them.\\n- **Vertical scaling**: Another option is to scale your application up vertically, meaning you can beef up the resources available to a single node. This would involve upgrading your server's capabilities to handle the additional load. If you opt for this type of scaling, make sure your application is designed to take advantage of these additional resources.\\n- **Caching**: By storing frequently accessed data, you can improve response times without needing to make repeated calls to our API. Your application will need to be designed to use cached data whenever possible and invalidate the cache when new information is added. There are a few different ways you could do this. For example, you could store data in a database, filesystem, or in-memory cache, depending on what makes the most sense for your application.\\n- **Load balancing**: Finally, consider load-balancing techniques to ensure requests are distributed evenly across your available servers. This could involve using a load balancer in front of your servers or using DNS round-robin. Balancing the load will help improve performance and reduce bottlenecks.\\n\\n### Managing rate limits\\n\\nWhen using our API, it's important to understand and plan for [rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).\\n\\n## Improving latencies\\n\\nCheck out our most up-to-date guide on [latency optimization](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/latency-optimization).\\n\\nLatency is the time it takes for a request to be processed and a response to be returned. In this section, we will discuss some factors that influence the latency of our text generation models and provide suggestions on how to reduce it.\\n\\nThe latency of a completion request is mostly influenced by two factors: the model and the number of tokens generated. The life cycle of a completion request looks like this:\\n\\nNetwork\\n\\nEnd user to API latency\\n\\nServer\\n\\nTime to process prompt tokens\\n\\nServer\\n\\nTime to sample/generate tokens\\n\\nNetwork\\n\\nAPI to end user latency\\n\\nThe bulk of the latency typically arises from the token generation step.\\n\\n> **Intuition**: Prompt tokens add very little latency to completion calls. Time to generate completion tokens is much longer, as tokens are generated one at a time. Longer generation lengths will accumulate latency due to generation required for each token.\\n\\n### Common factors affecting latency and possible mitigation techniques\\n\\nNow that we have looked at the basics of latency, let’s take a look at various factors that can affect latency, broadly ordered from most impactful to least impactful.\\n\\n#### Model\\n\\nOur API offers different models with varying levels of complexity and generality. The most capable models, such as `gpt-4`, can generate more complex and diverse completions, but they also take longer to process your query.\\nModels such as `gpt-4o-mini`, can generate faster and cheaper Chat Completions, but they may generate results that are less accurate or relevant for your query. You can choose the model that best suits your use case and the trade-off between speed, cost, and quality.\\n\\n#### Number of completion tokens\\n\\nRequesting a large amount of generated tokens completions can lead to increased latencies:\\n\\n- **Lower max tokens**: for requests with a similar token generation count, those that have a lower `max_tokens` parameter incur less latency.\\n- **Include stop sequences**: to prevent generating unneeded tokens, add a stop sequence. For example, you can use stop sequences to generate a list with a specific number of items. In this case, by using `11.` as a stop sequence, you can generate a list with only 10 items, since the completion will stop when `11.` is reached. [Read our help article on stop sequences](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5072263-how-do-i-use-stop-sequences) for more context on how you can do this.\\n- **Generate fewer completions**: lower the values of `n` and `best_of` when possible where `n` refers to how many completions to generate for each prompt and `best_of` is used to represent the result with the highest log probability per token.\\n\\nIf `n` and `best_of` both equal 1 (which is the default), the number of generated tokens will be at most, equal to `max_tokens`.\\n\\nIf `n` (the number of completions returned) or `best_of` (the number of completions generated for consideration) are set to `> 1`, each request will create multiple outputs. Here, you can consider the number of generated tokens as `[ max_tokens * max (n, best_of) ]`\\n\\n#### Streaming\\n\\nSetting `stream: true` in a request makes the model start returning tokens as soon as they are available, instead of waiting for the full sequence of tokens to be generated. It does not change the time to get all the tokens, but it reduces the time for first token for an application where we want to show partial progress or are going to stop generations. This can be a better user experience and a UX improvement so it’s worth experimenting with streaming.\\n\\n#### Infrastructure\\n\\nOur servers are currently located in the US. While we hope to have global redundancy in the future, in the meantime you could consider locating the relevant parts of your infrastructure in the US to minimize the roundtrip time between your servers and the OpenAI servers.\\n\\n#### Batching\\n\\nDepending on your use case, batching _may help_. If you are sending multiple requests to the same endpoint, you can [batch the prompts](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits#batching-requests) to be sent in the same request. This will reduce the number of requests you need to make. The prompt parameter can hold up to 20 unique prompts. We advise you to test out this method and see if it helps. In some cases, you may end up increasing the number of generated tokens which will slow the response time.\\n\\n## Managing costs\\n\\nTo monitor your costs, you can set a [notification threshold](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) in your account to receive an email alert once you pass a certain usage threshold. You can also set a [monthly budget](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits). Please be mindful of the potential for a monthly budget to cause disruptions to your application/users. Use the [usage tracking dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/usage) to monitor your token usage during the current and past billing cycles.\\n\\n### Text generation\\n\\nOne of the challenges of moving your prototype into production is budgeting for the costs associated with running your application. OpenAI offers a [pay-as-you-go pricing model](https://openai.com/api/pricing/), with prices per 1,000 tokens (roughly equal to 750 words). To estimate your costs, you will need to project the token utilization. Consider factors such as traffic levels, the frequency with which users will interact with your application, and the amount of data you will be processing.\\n\\n**One useful framework for thinking about reducing costs is to consider costs as a function of the number of tokens and the cost per token.** There are two potential avenues for reducing costs using this framework. First, you could work to reduce the cost per token by switching to smaller models for some tasks in order to reduce costs. Alternatively, you could try to reduce the number of tokens required. There are a few ways you could do this, such as by using shorter prompts, [fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization) models, or caching common user queries so that they don't need to be processed repeatedly.\\n\\nYou can experiment with our interactive [tokenizer tool](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) to help you estimate costs. The API and playground also returns token counts as part of the response. Once you’ve got things working with our most capable model, you can see if the other models can produce the same results with lower latency and costs. Learn more in our [token usage help article](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6614209-how-do-i-check-my-token-usage).\\n\\n## MLOps strategy\\n\\nAs you move your prototype into production, you may want to consider developing an MLOps strategy. MLOps (machine learning operations) refers to the process of managing the end-to-end life cycle of your machine learning models, including any models you may be fine-tuning using our API. There are a number of areas to consider when designing your MLOps strategy. These include\\n\\n- Data and model management: managing the data used to train or fine-tune your model and tracking versions and changes.\\n- Model monitoring: tracking your model's performance over time and detecting any potential issues or degradation.\\n- Model retraining: ensuring your model stays up to date with changes in data or evolving requirements and retraining or fine-tuning it as needed.\\n- Model deployment: automating the process of deploying your model and related artifacts into production.\\n\\nThinking through these aspects of your application will help ensure your model stays relevant and performs well over time.\\n\\n## Security and compliance\\n\\nAs you move your prototype into production, you will need to assess and address any security and compliance requirements that may apply to your application. This will involve examining the data you are handling, understanding how our API processes data, and determining what regulations you must adhere to. Our [security practices](https://www.openai.com/security) and [trust and compliance portal](https://trust.openai.com/) provide our most comprehensive and up-to-date documentation. For reference, here is our [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/api/policies/terms/).\\n\\nSome common areas you'll need to consider include data storage, data transmission, and data retention. You might also need to implement data privacy protections, such as encryption or anonymization where possible. In addition, you should follow best practices for secure coding, such as input sanitization and proper error handling.\\n\\n### Safety best practices\\n\\nWhen creating your application with our API, consider our [safety best practices](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices) to ensure your application is safe and successful. These recommendations highlight the importance of testing the product extensively, being proactive about addressing potential issues, and limiting opportunities for misuse.\\n\\n## Business considerations\\n\\nAs projects using AI move from prototype to production, it is important to consider how to build a great product with AI and how that ties back to your core business.

The full list of events that are yielded by the iterator are outlined [below](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#chat-completions-events).\\n\\nWhen the context manager exits, the response will be closed, however the `stream` instance is still available outside\\nthe context manager.\\n\\n### Chat Completions Events\\n\\n[Permalink: Chat Completions Events](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#chat-completions-events)\\n\\nThese events allow you to track the progress of the chat completion generation, access partial results, and handle different aspects of the stream separately.\\n\\nBelow is a list of the different event types you may encounter:\\n\\n#### ChunkEvent\\n\\n[Permalink: ChunkEvent](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#chunkevent)\\n\\nEmitted for every chunk received from the API.\\n\\n- `type`: `\\\"chunk\\\"`\\n- `chunk`: The raw `ChatCompletionChunk` object received from the API\\n- `snapshot`: The current accumulated state of the chat completion\\n\\n#### ContentDeltaEvent\\n\\n[Permalink: ContentDeltaEvent](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#contentdeltaevent)\\n\\nEmitted for every chunk containing new content.\\n\\n- `type`: `\\\"content.delta\\\"`\\n- `delta`: The new content string received in this chunk\\n- `snapshot`: The accumulated content so far\\n- `parsed`: The partially parsed content (if applicable)\\n\\n#### ContentDoneEvent\\n\\n[Permalink: ContentDoneEvent](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#contentdoneevent)\\n\\nEmitted when the content generation is complete.

Parsing Helpers](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers)\\n\\nThe OpenAI API supports extracting JSON from the model with the `response_format` request param, for more details on the API, see [this guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs).\\n\\nThe SDK provides a `client.chat.completions.parse()` method which is a wrapper over the `client.chat.completions.create()` that\\nprovides richer integrations with Python specific types & returns a `ParsedChatCompletion` object, which is a subclass of the standard `ChatCompletion` class.\\n\\n## Auto-parsing response content with Pydantic models\\n\\n[Permalink: Auto-parsing response content with Pydantic models](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#auto-parsing-response-content-with-pydantic-models)\\n\\nYou can pass a pydantic model to the `.parse()` method and the SDK will automatically convert the model\\ninto a JSON schema, send it to the API and parse the response content back into the given model.\\n\\n```\\nfrom typing import List\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\n\\nclass Step(BaseModel):\\n    explanation: str\\n    output: str\\n\\nclass MathResponse(BaseModel):\\n    steps: List[Step]\\n    final_answer: str\\n\\nclient = OpenAI()\\ncompletion = client.chat.completions.parse(\\n    model=\\\"gpt-4o-2024-08-06\\\",\\n    messages=[\\\\\\n        {\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"You are a helpful math tutor.\\\"},\\\\\\n        {\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"solve 8x + 31 = 2\\\"},\\\\\\n    ],\\n    response_format=MathResponse,\\n)\\n\\nmessage = completion.choices[0].message\\nif message.parsed:\\n    print(message.parsed.steps)\\n    print(\\\"answer: \\\", message.parsed.final_answer)\\nelse:\\n    print(message.refusal)\\n```\\n\\n## Auto-parsing function tool calls\\n\\n[Permalink: Auto-parsing function tool calls](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#auto-parsing-function-tool-calls)\\n\\nThe `.parse()` method will also automatically parse `function` tool calls if:\\n\\n- You use the `openai.pydantic_function_tool()` helper method\\n- You mark your tool schema with `\\\"strict\\\": True`\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n```\\nfrom enum import Enum\\nfrom typing import List, Union\\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\\nimport openai\\n\\nclass Table(str, Enum):\\n    orders = \\\"orders\\\"\\n    customers =

 delivered_at = \\\"delivered_at\\\"\\n    shipped_at = \\\"shipped_at\\\"\\n    ordered_at = \\\"ordered_at\\\"\\n    canceled_at = \\\"canceled_at\\\"\\n\\nclass Operator(str, Enum):\\n    eq = \\\"=\\\"\\n    gt = \\\">\\\"\\n    lt = \\\"<\\\"\\n    le = \\\"<=\\\"\\n    ge = \\\">=\\\"\\n    ne = \\\"!=\\\"\\n\\nclass OrderBy(str, Enum):\\n    asc = \\\"asc\\\"\\n    desc =

The full list of events that are yielded by the iterator are outlined [below](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#chat-completions-events).\\n\\nWhen the context manager exits, the response will be closed, however the `stream` instance is still available outside\\nthe context manager.\\n\\n### Chat Completions Events\\n\\n[Permalink: Chat Completions Events](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#chat-completions-events)\\n\\nThese events allow you to track the progress of the chat completion generation, access partial results, and handle different aspects of the stream separately.\\n\\nBelow is a list of the different event types you may encounter:\\n\\n#### ChunkEvent\\n\\n[Permalink: ChunkEvent](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#chunkevent)\\n\\nEmitted for every chunk received from the API.\\n\\n- `type`: `\\\"chunk\\\"`\\n- `chunk`: The raw `ChatCompletionChunk` object received from the API\\n- `snapshot`: The current accumulated state of the chat completion\\n\\n#### ContentDeltaEvent\\n\\n[Permalink: ContentDeltaEvent](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#contentdeltaevent)\\n\\nEmitted for every chunk containing new content.\\n\\n- `type`: `\\\"content.delta\\\"`\\n- `delta`: The new content string received in this chunk\\n- `snapshot`: The accumulated content so far\\n- `parsed`: The partially parsed content (if applicable)\\n\\n#### ContentDoneEvent\\n\\n[Permalink: ContentDoneEvent](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md#contentdoneevent)\\n\\nEmitted when the content generation is complete.

Alternatively, you may wish to develop your own content filtration system tailored to your use case.\\n\\n### Adversarial testing\\n\\nWe recommend “red-teaming” your application to ensure it's robust to adversarial input. Test your product over a wide range of inputs and user behaviors, both a representative set and those reflective of someone trying to ‘break' your application. Does it wander off topic? Can someone easily redirect the feature via prompt injections, e.g. “ignore the previous instructions and do this instead”?\\n\\n### Human in the loop (HITL)\\n\\nWherever possible, we recommend having a human review outputs before they are used in practice. This is especially critical in high-stakes domains, and for code generation. Humans should be aware of the limitations of the system, and have access to any information needed to verify the outputs (for example, if the application summarizes notes, a human should have easy access to the original notes to refer back).\\n\\n### Prompt engineering\\n\\n“Prompt engineering” can help constrain the topic and tone of output text. This reduces the chance of producing undesired content, even if a user tries to produce it. Providing additional context to the model (such as by giving a few high-quality examples of desired behavior prior to the new input) can make it easier to steer model outputs in desired directions.\\n\\n### “Know your customer” (KYC)\\n\\nUsers should generally need to register and log-in to access your service. Linking this service to an existing account, such as a Gmail, LinkedIn, or Facebook log-in, may help, though may not be appropriate for all use-cases. Requiring a credit card or ID card reduces risk further.\\n\\n### Constrain user input and limit output tokens\\n\\nLimiting the amount of text a user can input into the prompt helps avoid prompt injection. Limiting the number of output tokens helps reduce the chance of misuse.\\n\\nNarrowing the ranges of inputs or outputs, especially drawn from trusted sources, reduces the extent of misuse possible within an application.\\n\\nAllowing user inputs through validated dropdown fields (e.g., a list of movies on Wikipedia) can be more secure than allowing open-ended text inputs.\\n\\nReturning outputs from a validated set of materials on the backend, where possible, can be safer than returning novel generated content (for instance, routing a customer query to the best-matching existing customer support article, rather than attempting to answer the query from-scratch).\\n\\n### Allow users to report issues\\n\\nUsers should generally have an easily-available method for reporting improper functionality or other concerns about application behavior (listed email address, ticket submission method, etc). This method should be monitored by a human and responded to as appropriate.\\n\\n### Understand and communicate limitations\\n\\nFrom hallucinating inaccurate information, to offensive outputs, to bias, and much more, language models may not be suitable for every use case without significant modifications. Consider whether the model is fit for your purpose, and evaluate the performance of the API on a wide range of potential inputs in order to identify cases where the API's performance might drop. Consider your customer base and the range of inputs that they will be using, and ensure their expectations are calibrated appropriately.\\n\\n**Safety and security are very important to us at OpenAI**.\\n\\nIf you notice any safety or security issues while developing with the API or anything else related to OpenAI, please submit it through our [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://openai.com/security/disclosure/).\\n\\n### Implement safety identifiers\\n\\nSending safety identifiers in your requests can be a useful tool to help OpenAI monitor and detect abuse. This allows OpenAI to provide your team with more actionable feedback in the event that we detect any policy violations in your application.\\n\\nA safety identifier should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. Hash the username or email address in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. If you offer a preview of your product to non-logged in users, you can send a session ID instead.\\n\\nInclude safety identifiers in your API requests with the `safety_identifier` parameter:\\n\\nExample: Providing a safety identifier\\n\\npython\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\\n  model=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\",\\n  messages=[\\\\\\n    {\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"This is a test\\\"}\\\\\\n  ],\\n  max_tokens=5,\\n  safety_identifier=\\\"user_123456\\\"\\n)\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -d '{\\n  \\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\",\\n  \\\"messages\\\": [\\\\\\n    {\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"This is a test\\\"}\\\\\\n  ],\\n  \\\"max_tokens\\\": 5,\\n  \\\"safety_identifier\\\": \\\"user123456\\\"\\n}'\\n```\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"twitter:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"theme-color\": \"#000000\",\n    \"og:title\": \"Safety best practices - OpenAI API\",\n    \"ogUrl\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"og:description\": \"Learn how to implement safety measures like moderation, adversarial testing, human oversight, and prompt engineering to ensure responsible AI deployment.\",\n    \"og:type\": \"website\",\n    \"ogDescription\": \"Learn how to implement safety measures like moderation, adversarial testing, human oversight, and prompt engineering to ensure responsible AI deployment.\",\n    \"og:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"favicon\": \"https://platform.openai.com/favicon-platform.png\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"twitter:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"twitter:title\": \"Safety best practices - OpenAI API\",\n    \"twitter:description\": \"Learn how to implement safety measures like moderation, adversarial testing, human oversight, and prompt engineering to ensure responsible AI deployment.\",\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\n    \"ogTitle\": \"Safety best practices - OpenAI API\",\n    \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n    \"og:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n    \"twitter:domain\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n    \"title\": \"Safety best practices - OpenAI API\",\n    \"description\": \"Learn how to implement safety measures like moderation, adversarial testing, human oversight, and prompt engineering to ensure responsible AI deployment.\",\n    \"scrapeId\": \"29397379-1465-47ea-b367-8b001b35bea0\",\n    \"sourceURL\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices\",\n    \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n    \"proxyUsed\": \"basic\",\n    \"cacheState\": \"hit\",\n    \"cachedAt\": \"2025-10-02T23:12:55.394Z\",\n    \"creditsUsed\": 1\n  }\n}"}]}]},"uuid":"99f67e6d-553d-4dbd-8d48-1029fb24373e","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:06:41.336Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"{\n  \"markdown\": \"Log in [Sign up](https://platform.openai.com/signup)\\n\\n# Safety best practices\\n\\nImplement safety measures like moderation and human oversight.\\n\\nCopy page\\n\\n### Use our free Moderation API\\n\\nOpenAI's [Moderation API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation) is free-to-use and can help reduce the frequency of unsafe content in your completions.

This is especially critical in high-stakes domains, and for code generation. Humans should be aware of the limitations of the system, and have access to any information needed to verify the outputs (for example, if the application summarizes notes, a human should have easy access to the original notes to refer back).\\n\\n### Prompt engineering\\n\\n“Prompt engineering” can help constrain the topic and tone of output text. This reduces the chance of producing undesired content, even if a user tries to produce it. Providing additional context to the model (such as by giving a few high-quality examples of desired behavior prior to the new input) can make it easier to steer model outputs in desired directions.\\n\\n### “Know your customer” (KYC)\\n\\nUsers should generally need to register and log-in to access your service. Linking this service to an existing account, such as a Gmail, LinkedIn, or Facebook log-in, may help, though may not be appropriate for all use-cases. Requiring a credit card or ID card reduces risk further.\\n\\n### Constrain user input and limit output tokens\\n\\nLimiting the amount of text a user can input into the prompt helps avoid prompt injection. Limiting the number of output tokens helps reduce the chance of misuse.\\n\\nNarrowing the ranges of inputs or outputs, especially drawn from trusted sources, reduces the extent of misuse possible within an application.\\n\\nAllowing user inputs through validated dropdown fields (e.g., a list of movies on Wikipedia) can be more secure than allowing open-ended text inputs.\\n\\nReturning outputs from a validated set of materials on the backend, where possible, can be safer than returning novel generated content (for instance, routing a customer query to the best-matching existing customer support article, rather than attempting to answer the query from-scratch).\\n\\n### Allow users to report issues\\n\\nUsers should generally have an easily-available method for reporting improper functionality or other concerns about application behavior (listed email address, ticket submission method, etc). This method should be monitored by a human and responded to as appropriate.\\n\\n### Understand and communicate limitations\\n\\nFrom hallucinating inaccurate information, to offensive outputs, to bias, and much more, language models may not be suitable for every use case without significant modifications. Consider whether the model is fit for your purpose, and evaluate the performance of the API on a wide range of potential inputs in order to identify cases where the API's performance might drop. Consider your customer base and the range of inputs that they will be using, and ensure their expectations are calibrated appropriately.\\n\\n**Safety and security are very important to us at OpenAI**.\\n\\nIf you notice any safety or security issues while developing with the API or anything else related to OpenAI, please submit it through our [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://openai.com/security/disclosure/).\\n\\n### Implement safety identifiers\\n\\nSending safety identifiers in your requests can be a useful tool to help OpenAI monitor and detect abuse. This allows OpenAI to provide your team with more actionable feedback in the event that we detect any policy violations in your application.\\n\\nA safety identifier should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. Hash the username or email address in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. If you offer a preview of your product to non-logged in users, you can send a session ID instead.\\n\\nInclude safety identifiers in your API requests with the `safety_identifier` parameter:\\n\\nExample: Providing a safety identifier\\n\\npython\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\\n  model=\\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\",\\n  messages=[\\\\\\n    {\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"This is a test\\\"}\\\\\\n  ],\\n  max_tokens=5,\\n  safety_identifier=\\\"user_123456\\\"\\n)\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -d '{\\n  \\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-4o-mini\\\",\\n  \\\"messages\\\": [\\\\\\n    {\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"This is a test\\\"}\\\\\\n  ],\\n  \\\"max_tokens\\\": 5,\\n  \\\"safety_identifier\\\": \\\"user123456\\\"\\n}'\\n```\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"twitter:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"theme-color\": \"#000000\",\n    \"og:title\": \"Safety best practices - OpenAI API\",\n    \"ogUrl\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"og:description\": \"Learn how to implement safety measures like moderation, adversarial testing, human oversight, and prompt engineering to ensure responsible AI deployment.\",\n    \"og:type\": \"website\",\n    \"ogDescription\": \"Learn how to implement safety measures like moderation, adversarial testing, human oversight, and prompt engineering to ensure responsible AI deployment.\",\n    \"og:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"favicon\": \"https://platform.openai.com/favicon-platform.png\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"twitter:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"twitter:title\": \"Safety best practices - OpenAI API\",\n    \"twitter:description\": \"Learn how to implement safety measures like moderation, adversarial testing, human oversight, and prompt engineering to ensure responsible AI deployment.\",\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\n    \"ogTitle\": \"Safety best practices - OpenAI API\",\n    \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n    \"og:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n    \"twitter:domain\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n    \"title\": \"Safety best practices - OpenAI API\",\n    \"description\": \"Learn how to implement safety measures like moderation, adversarial testing, human oversight, and prompt engineering to ensure responsible AI deployment.\",\n    \"scrapeId\": \"29397379-1465-47ea-b367-8b001b35bea0\",\n    \"sourceURL\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices\",\n    \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n    \"proxyUsed\": \"basic\",\n    \"cacheState\": \"hit\",\n    \"cachedAt\": \"2025-10-02T23:12:55.394Z\",\n    \"creditsUsed\": 1\n  }\n}"}]}

Note that our support queue times may be long due to high demand. You can also [post in our Community Forum](https://community.openai.com/) but be sure to omit any sensitive information.\n\n## Handling errors\n\nWe advise you to programmatically handle errors returned by the API. To do so, you may want to use a code snippet like below:\n\n```python\nimport openai\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ntry:\n  #Make your OpenAI API request here\n  response = client.chat.completions.create(\n    prompt=\"Hello world\",\n    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\"\n  )\nexcept openai.APIError as e:\n  #Handle API error here, e.g. retry or log\n  print(f\"OpenAI API returned an API Error: {e}\")\n  pass\nexcept openai.APIConnectionError as e:\n  #Handle connection error here\n  print(f\"Failed to connect to OpenAI API: {e}\")\n  pass\nexcept openai.RateLimitError as e:\n  #Handle rate limit error (we recommend using exponential backoff)\n  print(f\"OpenAI API request exceeded rate limit: {e}\")\n  pass\n```\n"}},{"type":"tool_use","id":"toolu_01BissU2f4hzVaiz2Brn8uZo","name":"Write","input":{"file_path":"/Users/natedamstra/socialaize/claude-docs/ai/openai/rate-limits-guide.md","content":"# Rate limits\n\nUnderstand API rate limits and restrictions.\n\nRate limits are restrictions that our API imposes on the number of times a user or client can\naccess our services within a specified period of time.\n\n## Why do we have rate limits?\n\nRate limits are a common practice for APIs, and they're put in place for a few different reasons:\n\n- **They help protect against abuse or misuse of the API.** For example, a malicious actor could flood the API with requests in an attempt to overload it or cause disruptions in service. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can prevent this kind of activity.\n- **Rate limits help ensure that everyone has fair access to the API.** If one person or organization makes an excessive number of requests, it could bog down the API for everyone else. By throttling the number of requests that a single user can make, OpenAI ensures that the most number of people have an opportunity to use the API without experiencing slowdowns.\n- **Rate limits can help OpenAI manage the aggregate load on its infrastructure.** If requests to the API increase dramatically, it could tax the servers and cause performance issues. By setting rate limits, OpenAI can help maintain a smooth and consistent experience for all users.\n\nPlease work through this document in its entirety to better understand how OpenAI's rate limit system works. We include code examples and possible solutions to handle common issues. We also include details around how your rate limits are automatically increased in the usage tiers section below.\n\n## How do these rate limits work?\n\nRate limits are measured in five ways: **RPM** (requests per minute), **RPD** (requests per day), **TPM** (tokens per minute), **TPD** (tokens per day), and **IPM** (images per minute). Rate limits can be hit across any of the options depending on what occurs first. For example, you might send 20 requests with only 100 tokens to the ChatCompletions endpoint and that would fill your limit (if your RPM was 20), even if you did not send 150k tokens (if your TPM limit was 150k) within those 20 requests.\n\n[Batch API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch/create) queue limits are calculated based on the total number of input tokens queued for a given model. Tokens from pending batch jobs are counted against your queue limit. Once a batch job is completed, its tokens are no longer counted against that model's limit.\n\nOther important things worth noting:\n\n- Rate limits are defined at the [organization level](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/production-best-practices) and at the project level, not user level.\n- Rate limits vary by the [model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) being used.\n- For long context models like GPT-4.1, there is a separate rate limit for long context requests. You can view these rate limits in [developer console](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).\n- Limits are also placed on the total amount an organization can spend on the API each month. These are also known as \"usage limits\".\n- Some model families have shared rate limits. Any models listed under a \"shared limit\" in your [organizations limit page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) share a rate limit between them. For example, if the listed shared TPM is 3.5M, all calls to any model in the given \"shared limit\" list will count towards that 3.5M.\n\n## Usage tiers\n\nYou can view the rate and usage limits for your organization under the [limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) section of your account settings. As your spend on our API goes up, we automatically graduate you to the next usage tier. This usually results in an increase in rate limits across most models.\n\n| Tier | Qualification | Usage limits |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Free | User must be in an [allowed geography](https://platform.openai.com/docs/supported-countries) | $100 / month |\n| Tier 1 | $5 paid | $100 / month |\n| Tier 2 | $50 paid and 7+ days since first successful payment | $500 / month |\n| Tier 3 | $100 paid and 7+ days since first successful payment | $1,000 / month |\n| Tier 4 | $250 paid and 14+ days since first successful payment | $5,000 / month |\n| Tier 5 | $1,000 paid and 30+ days since first successful payment | $200,000 / month |\n\nTo view a high-level summary of rate limits per model, visit the [models page](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).\n\n## Rate limits in headers\n\nIn addition to seeing your rate limit on your [account page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits), you can also view important information about your rate limits such as the remaining requests, tokens, and other metadata in the headers of the HTTP response.\n\nYou can expect to see the following header fields:\n\n| Field | Sample Value | Description |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| x-ratelimit-limit-requests | 60 | The maximum number of requests that are permitted before exhausting the rate limit. |\n| x-ratelimit-limit-tokens | 150000 | The maximum number of tokens that are permitted before exhausting the rate limit. |\n| x-ratelimit-remaining-requests | 59 | The remaining number of requests that are permitted before exhausting the rate limit. |\n| x-ratelimit-remaining-tokens | 149984 | The remaining number of tokens that are permitted before exhausting the rate limit. |\n| x-ratelimit-reset-requests | 1s | The time until the rate limit (based on requests) resets to its initial state. |\n| x-ratelimit-reset-tokens | 6m0s | The time until the rate limit (based on tokens) resets to its initial state. |\n\n## Fine-tuning rate limits\n\nThe fine-tuning rate limits for your organization can be [found in the dashboard as well](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits), and can also be retrieved via API:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/model_limits \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\"\n```\n\n## Error mitigation\n\n### What are some steps I can take to mitigate this?\n\nThe OpenAI Cookbook has a [Python notebook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_handle_rate_limits) that explains how to avoid rate limit errors, as well an example [Python script](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/api_request_parallel_processor.py) for staying under rate limits while batch processing API requests.\n\nYou should also exercise caution when providing programmatic access, bulk processing features, and automated social media posting - consider only enabling these for trusted customers.\n\nTo protect against automated and high-volume misuse, set a usage limit for individual users within a specified time frame (daily, weekly, or monthly). Consider implementing a hard cap or a manual review process for users who exceed the limit.\n\n### Retrying with exponential backoff\n\nOne easy way to avoid rate limit errors is to automatically retry requests with a random exponential backoff. Retrying with exponential backoff means performing a short sleep when a rate limit error is hit, then retrying the unsuccessful request. If the request is still unsuccessful, the sleep length is increased and the process is repeated. This continues until the request is successful or until a maximum number of retries is reached.\n\nThis approach has many benefits:\n\n- Automatic retries means you can recover from rate limit errors without crashes or missing data\n- Exponential backoff means that your first retries can be tried quickly, while still benefiting from longer delays if your first few retries fail\n- Adding random jitter to the delay helps retries from all hitting at the same time.\n\nNote that unsuccessful requests contribute to your per-minute limit, so continuously resending a request won't work.\n\nBelow are a few example solutions **for Python** that use exponential backoff.\n\n#### Example 1: Using the Tenacity library\n\nTenacity is an Apache 2.0 licensed general-purpose retrying library, written in Python, to simplify the task of adding retry behavior to just about anything.\n\nTo add exponential backoff to your requests, you can use the `tenacity.retry` decorator. The below example uses the `tenacity.wait_random_exponential` function to add random exponential backoff to a request.\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nfrom tenacity import (\n    retry,\n    stop_after_attempt,\n    wait_random_exponential,\n)  # for exponential backoff\n\n@retry(wait=wait_random_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(6))\ndef completion_with_backoff(**kwargs):\n    return client.completions.create(**kwargs)\n\ncompletion_with_backoff(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", prompt=\"Once upon a time,\")\n```\n\nNote that the Tenacity library is a third-party tool, and OpenAI makes no guarantees about its reliability or security.\n\n#### Example 2: Using the backoff library\n\nAnother python library that provides function decorators for backoff and retry is [backoff](https://pypi.org/project/backoff/):\n\n```python\nimport backoff\nimport openai\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n@backoff.on_exception(backoff.expo, openai.RateLimitError)\ndef completions_with_backoff(**kwargs):\n    return client.completions.create(**kwargs)\n\ncompletions_with_backoff(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", prompt=\"Once upon a time,\")\n```\n\nLike Tenacity, the backoff library is a third-party tool, and OpenAI makes no guarantees about its reliability or security.\n\n#### Example 3: Manual backoff implementation\n\nIf you don't want to use third-party libraries, you can implement your own backoff logic following this example:\n\n```python\n# imports\nimport random\nimport time\n\nimport openai\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\n# define a retry decorator\ndef retry_with_exponential_backoff(\n    func,\n    initial_delay: float = 1,\n    exponential_base: float = 2,\n    jitter: bool = True,\n    max_retries: int = 10,\n    errors: tuple = (openai.RateLimitError,),\n):\n    \"\"\"Retry a function with exponential backoff.\"\"\"\n\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        # Initialize variables\n        num_retries = 0\n        delay = initial_delay\n\n        # Loop until a successful response or max_retries is hit or an exception is raised\n        while True:\n            try:\n                return func(*args, **kwargs)\n\n            # Retry on specific errors\n            except errors as e:\n                # Increment retries\n                num_retries += 1\n\n                # Check if max retries has been reached\n                if num_retries > max_retries:\n                    raise Exception(\n                        f\"Maximum number of retries ({max_retries}) exceeded.\"\n                    )\n\n                # Increment the delay\n                delay *= exponential_base * (1 + jitter * random.random())\n\n                # Sleep for the delay\n                time.sleep(delay)\n\n            # Raise exceptions for any errors not specified\n            except Exception as e:\n                raise e\n\n    return wrapper\n\n@retry_with_exponential_backoff\ndef completions_with_backoff(**kwargs):\n    return client.completions.create(**kwargs)\n```\n\nAgain, OpenAI makes no guarantees on the security or efficiency of this solution but it can be a good starting place for your own solution.\n\n### Reduce the `max_tokens` to match the size of your completions\n\nYour rate limit is calculated as the maximum of `max_tokens` and the estimated number of tokens based on the character count of your request. Try to set the `max_tokens` value as close to your expected response size as possible.\n\n### Batching requests\n\nIf your use case does not require immediate responses, you can use the [Batch API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch) to more easily submit and execute large collections of requests without impacting your synchronous request rate limits.\n\nFor use cases that _do_ requires synchronous responses, the OpenAI API has separate limits for **requests per minute** and **tokens per minute**.\n\nIf you're hitting the limit on requests per minute but have available capacity on tokens per minute, you can increase your throughput by batching multiple tasks into each request. This will allow you to process more tokens per minute, especially with our smaller models.\n\nSending in a batch of prompts works exactly the same as a normal API call, except you pass in a list of strings to the prompt parameter instead of a single string.

The current date is August 6, 2024. You help users query for the data they are looking for by calling the query function.\",\n        },\n        {\n            \"role\": \"user\",\n            \"content\": \"look up all my orders in may of last year that were fulfilled but not delivered on time\",\n        },\n    ],\n    tools=[\n        openai.pydantic_function_tool(Query),\n    ],\n)\n\ntool_call = (completion.choices[0].message.tool_calls or [])[0]\nprint(tool_call.function)\nassert isinstance(tool_call.function.parsed_arguments, Query)\nprint(tool_call.function.parsed_arguments.table_name)\n```\n\n## Differences from `.create()`\n\nThe `chat.completions.parse()` method imposes some additional restrictions on it's usage that `chat.completions.create()` does not.\n\n- If the completion completes with `finish_reason` set to `length` or `content_filter`, the `LengthFinishReasonError` / `ContentFilterFinishReasonError` errors will be raised.\n- Only strict function tools can be passed, e.g. `{'type': 'function', 'function': {..., 'strict': True}}`\n\n# Streaming Helpers\n\nOpenAI supports streaming responses when interacting with the [Chat Completion](#chat-completions-api) & [Assistant](#assistant-streaming-api) APIs.\n\n## Chat Completions API\n\nThe SDK provides a `.chat.completions.stream()` method that wraps the `.chat.completions.create(stream=True)` stream providing a more granular event API & automatic accumulation of each delta.\n\nIt also supports all aforementioned [parsing helpers](#structured-outputs-parsing-helpers).\n\nUnlike `.create(stream=True)`, the `.stream()` method requires usage within a context manager to prevent accidental leakage of the response:\n\n```python\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\n\nclient = AsyncOpenAI()\n\nasync with client.chat.completions.stream(\n    model='gpt-4o-2024-08-06',\n    messages=[...],\n) as stream:\n    async for event in stream:\n        if event.type == 'content.delta':\n            print(event.content, flush=True, end='')\n```\n\nWhen the context manager is entered, a `ChatCompletionStream` / `AsyncChatCompletionStream` instance is returned which, like `.create(stream=True)` is an iterator in the sync client and an async iterator in the async client. The full list of events that are yielded by the iterator are outlined [below](#chat-completions-events).\n\nWhen the context manager exits, the response will be closed, however the `stream` instance is still available outside\nthe context manager.\n\nFor complete documentation on streaming events, methods, and the Assistant Streaming API, see the full helpers.md documentation.\n\n# Polling Helpers\n\nWhen interacting with the API some actions such as starting a Run and adding files to vector stores are asynchronous and take time to complete.\nThe SDK includes helper functions which will poll the status until it reaches a terminal state and then return the resulting object.\nIf an API method results in an action which could benefit from polling there will be a corresponding version of the\nmethod ending in `_and_poll`.\n\nAll methods also allow you to set the polling frequency, how often the API is checked for an update, via a function argument ( `poll_interval_ms`).\n\nThe polling methods are:\n\n```python\nclient.beta.threads.create_and_run_poll(...)\nclient.beta.threads.runs.create_and_poll(...)\nclient.beta.threads.runs.submit_tool_outputs_and_poll(...)\nclient.beta.vector_stores.files.upload_and_poll(...)\nclient.beta.vector_stores.files.create_and_poll(...)\nclient.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.create_and_poll(...)\nclient.beta.vector_stores.file_batches.upload_and_poll(...)\n```\n\n---\n\n**Source:** [OpenAI Python SDK helpers.md](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/helpers.md)\nEOFMARKER\n","description":"Save error-handling-sdk.md (SDK helpers documentation)"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":657,"cache_read_input_tokens":77719,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":657,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3309,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTmBwBWLg57ac47f3tjgD","type":"assistant","uuid":"bda2c7b7-b570-4a3c-afe9-88c4c3c513dd","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:12:06.804Z"}

Alternatively, you may wish to develop your own content filtration system tailored to your use case.\n\n## Adversarial testing\n\nWe recommend \"red-teaming\" your application to ensure it's robust to adversarial input. Test your product over a wide range of inputs and user behaviors, both a representative set and those reflective of someone trying to 'break' your application. Does it wander off topic? Can someone easily redirect the feature via prompt injections, e.g. \"ignore the previous instructions and do this instead\"?\n\n## Human in the loop (HITL)\n\nWherever possible, we recommend having a human review outputs before they are used in practice. This is especially critical in high-stakes domains, and for code generation. Humans should be aware of the limitations of the system, and have access to any information needed to verify the outputs (for example, if the application summarizes notes, a human should have easy access to the original notes to refer back).\n\n## Prompt engineering\n\n\"Prompt engineering\" can help constrain the topic and tone of output text. This reduces the chance of producing undesired content, even if a user tries to produce it. Providing additional context to the model (such as by giving a few high-quality examples of desired behavior prior to the new input) can make it easier to steer model outputs in desired directions.\n\n## \"Know your customer\" (KYC)\n\nUsers should generally need to register and log-in to access your service. Linking this service to an existing account, such as a Gmail, LinkedIn, or Facebook log-in, may help, though may not be appropriate for all use-cases. Requiring a credit card or ID card reduces risk further.\n\n## Constrain user input and limit output tokens\n\nLimiting the amount of text a user can input into the prompt helps avoid prompt injection. Limiting the number of output tokens helps reduce the chance of misuse.\n\nNarrowing the ranges of inputs or outputs, especially drawn from trusted sources, reduces the extent of misuse possible within an application.\n\nAllowing user inputs through validated dropdown fields (e.g., a list of movies on Wikipedia) can be more secure than allowing open-ended text inputs.\n\nReturning outputs from a validated set of materials on the backend, where possible, can be safer than returning novel generated content (for instance, routing a customer query to the best-matching existing customer support article, rather than attempting to answer the query from-scratch).\n\n## Allow users to report issues\n\nUsers should generally have an easily-available method for reporting improper functionality or other concerns about application behavior (listed email address, ticket submission method, etc). This method should be monitored by a human and responded to as appropriate.\n\n## Understand and communicate limitations\n\nFrom hallucinating inaccurate information, to offensive outputs, to bias, and much more, language models may not be suitable for every use case without significant modifications. Consider whether the model is fit for your purpose, and evaluate the performance of the API on a wide range of potential inputs in order to identify cases where the API's performance might drop. Consider your customer base and the range of inputs that they will be using, and ensure their expectations are calibrated appropriately.\n\n**Safety and security are very important to us at OpenAI**.\n\nIf you notice any safety or security issues while developing with the API or anything else related to OpenAI, please submit it through our [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://openai.com/security/disclosure/).\n\n## Implement safety identifiers\n\nSending safety identifiers in your requests can be a useful tool to help OpenAI monitor and detect abuse. This allows OpenAI to provide your team with more actionable feedback in the event that we detect any policy violations in your application.\n\nA safety identifier should be a string that uniquely identifies each user. Hash the username or email address in order to avoid sending us any identifying information. If you offer a preview of your product to non-logged in users, you can send a session ID instead.\n\nInclude safety identifiers in your API requests with the `safety_identifier` parameter:\n\n### Example: Providing a safety identifier\n\n**Python:**\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nresponse = client.chat.completions.create(\n  model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n  messages=[\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"This is a test\"}\n  ],\n  max_tokens=5,\n  safety_identifier=\"user_123456\"\n)\n```\n\n**cURL:**\n```bash\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4o-mini\",\n  \"messages\": [\n    {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"This is a test\"}\n  ],\n  \"max_tokens\": 5,\n  \"safety_identifier\": \"user123456\"\n}'\n```\n\n---\n\n**Source:** [OpenAI Safety Best Practices](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices)\nEOFMARKER\n","description":"Save safety-best-practices.md"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":657,"cache_read_input_tokens":77719,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":657,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3309,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTmBwBWLg57ac47f3tjgD","type":"assistant","uuid":"ca35c516-ef1e-4917-914a-c18746b3404f","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:12:40.615Z"}

Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":39,"oldLines":26,"newStart":39,"newLines":34,"lines":[" "," ### OpenAI Documentation"," **Location:** `claude-docs/ai/openai/`","+","+#### Core API & Function Calling"," -

Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":102,"oldLines":6,"newStart":102,"newLines":24,"lines":[" -

Compound overview\n   - https://console.groq.com/docs/agentic-tooling - Agentic tooling\n\n2. **Integrations**\n   - https://console.groq.com/docs/llama-index - LlamaIndex integration\n\n### Priority 3: Reference Materials (As Needed)\n\n**LlamaIndex:**\n- Specific tool implementations (Arxiv, Bing Search, etc.) - scrape on demand\n- Reader integrations - scrape when implementing data ingestion\n- Advanced workflow patterns - scrape when scaling\n\n**OpenAI:**\n- Specific model variants - scrape when switching models\n- Audio/Vision APIs - scrape when adding multimedia features\n- Assistants API - scrape if implementing persistent agents\n\n**Groq:**\n- Specific model documentation - scrape when comparing/switching\n- Integration-specific guides - scrape when implementing\n\n---\n\n## Scraping Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Immediate)\n**Target: ~40-50 pages**\n- LlamaIndex Python: Workflows, tools, LLM integration (~15 pages)\n- **LlamaIndex TypeScript**: Workflows, LLM packages, chat patterns (~10 pages)\n- OpenAI: Chat API, function calling, streaming, models (~15 pages)\n- Groq: OpenAI compatibility, rate limits, tool use (~5 pages)\n\n**Key Addition**: TypeScript LlamaIndex docs are CRITICAL as the frontend uses `@llamaindex/*` packages\n\n### Phase 2: Production Readiness (Next Sprint)\n**Target: ~20-30 pages**\n- Error handling patterns\n- Rate limits and billing optimization\n- Best practices for streaming\n- Evaluation and observability\n\n### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)\n**Target: ~30-40 pages**\n- RAG implementation (when adding content search)\n- Embeddings (for content similarity)\n- Batch processing (for bulk operations)\n- Fine-tuning (for custom models)\n\n**Total Estimated:** ~100-120 high-value pages vs 1,069 total available (~10% focused scraping)\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Dual Implementation Architecture\nThe platform uses a **dual AI architecture**:\n\n1. **Backend (Python)**: `/functions/AI_API/`\n   - Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":16,"oldLines":27,"newStart":16,"newLines":31,"lines":[" "," ### LlamaIndex Python Documentation"," **Location:** `claude-docs/ai/llamaindex-python/`","-- ✅ **workflows-guide.md** (1.4KB) -

scrape when adding multimedia features\n- Assistants API - scrape if implementing persistent agents\n\n**Groq:**\n- Specific model documentation - scrape when comparing/switching\n- Integration-specific guides - scrape when implementing\n\n---\n\n## Scraping Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Immediate)\n**Target: ~40-50 pages**\n- LlamaIndex Python: Workflows, tools, LLM integration (~15 pages)\n- **LlamaIndex TypeScript**: Workflows, LLM packages, chat patterns (~10 pages)\n- OpenAI: Chat API, function calling, streaming, models (~15 pages)\n- Groq: OpenAI compatibility, rate limits, tool use (~5 pages)\n\n**Key Addition**: TypeScript LlamaIndex docs are CRITICAL as the frontend uses `@llamaindex/*` packages\n\n### Phase 2: Production Readiness (Next Sprint)\n**Target: ~20-30 pages**\n- Error handling patterns\n- Rate limits and billing optimization\n- Best practices for streaming\n- Evaluation and observability\n\n### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)\n**Target: ~30-40 pages**\n- RAG implementation (when adding content search)\n- Embeddings (for content similarity)\n- Batch processing (for bulk operations)\n- Fine-tuning (for custom models)\n\n**Total Estimated:** ~100-120 high-value pages vs 1,069 total available (~10% focused scraping)\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Dual Implementation Architecture\nThe platform uses a **dual AI architecture**:\n\n1. **Backend (Python)**: `/functions/AI_API/`\n   - Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":6,"oldLines":13,"newStart":6,"newLines":13,"lines":[" "," ### LlamaIndex TypeScript Documentation"," **Location:** `claude-docs/ai/llamaindex-typescript/`","-- ✅ **home.md** (8.8KB) -

Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":45,"oldLines":31,"newStart":45,"newLines":31,"lines":[" **Location:** `claude-docs/ai/openai/`"," "," #### Core API & Function Calling","-- ✅ **openai-python-readme.md** (17.5KB) -

Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":96,"oldLines":15,"newStart":96,"newLines":15,"lines":[" ## Phase 1 Scraping Complete ✅"," "," **Total Documentation Scraped:**","-- **36 documents**","-- **~295KB of documentation**","+- **34 documents**","+- **~243KB of documentation**"," -

Take a look below for the full set of guides for each one!\\n\\n**NOTE:**\\n\\nObservability is now being handled via the [`instrumentation` module](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability/instrumentation) (available in v0.10.20 and later.)\\n\\nA lot of the tooling and integrations mentioned in this page use our legacy `CallbackManager` or don’t use `set_global_handler`. We’ve marked these integrations as such!\\n\\n## Usage Pattern\\n\\n[Section titled “Usage Pattern”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#usage-pattern)\\n\\nTo toggle, you will generally just need to do the following:\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\nNote that all `kwargs` to `set_global_handler` are passed to the underlying callback handler.\\n\\nAnd that’s it! Executions will get seamlessly piped to downstream service and you’ll be able to access features such as viewing execution traces of your application.\\n\\n## Integrations\\n\\n[Section titled “Integrations”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#integrations)\\n\\n### OpenTelemetry\\n\\n[Section titled “OpenTelemetry”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#opentelemetry)\\n\\n[OpenTelemetry](https://openetelemetry.io/) is a widely used open-source service for tracing and observability, with numerous backend integrations (such as Jaeger, Zipkin or Prometheus).\\n\\nOur OpenTelemetry integration traces all the events produced by pieces of LlamaIndex code, including LLMs, Agents, RAG pipeline components and many more: everything you would get out with LlamaIndex native instrumentation you can export in OpenTelemetry format!\\n\\nYou can install the library with:\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\nAnd can use it in your code with the default settings, as in this example with a RAG pipeline:\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\nOr you can use a more complex and customized set-up, such as in the following example:\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\nWe also have a [demo repository](https://github.com/run-llama/agents-observability-demo) where we show how to trace agentic workflows and pipe the registered traces into a Postgres database.\\n\\n### LlamaTrace (Hosted Arize Phoenix)\\n\\n[Section titled “LlamaTrace (Hosted Arize Phoenix)”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#llamatrace-hosted-arize-phoenix)\\n\\nWe’ve partnered with Arize on [LlamaTrace](https://llamatrace.com/), a hosted tracing, observability, and evaluation platform that works natively with LlamaIndex open-source users and has integrations with LlamaCloud.\\n\\nThis is built upon the open-source Arize [Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) project. Phoenix provides a notebook-first experience for monitoring your models and LLM Applications by providing:\\n\\n- LLM Traces - Trace through the execution of your LLM Application to understand the internals of your LLM Application and to troubleshoot problems related to things like retrieval and tool execution.\\n- LLM Evals - Leverage the power of large language models to evaluate your generative model or application’s relevance, toxicity, and more.\\n\\n#### Usage Pattern\\n\\n[Section titled “Usage Pattern”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#usage-pattern-1)\\n\\nTo install the integration package, do `pip install -U llama-index-callbacks-arize-phoenix`.\\n\\nThen create an account on LlamaTrace: [https://llamatrace.com/login](https://llamatrace.com/login). Create an API key and put it in the `PHOENIX_API_KEY` variable below.\\n\\nThen run the following code:\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\n#### Guides\\n\\n[Section titled “Guides”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#guides)\\n\\n- [LlamaCloud Agent with LlamaTrace](https://github.com/run-llama/llamacloud-demo/blob/main/examples/tracing/llamacloud_tracing_phoenix.ipynb)\\n\\n![](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/_astro/arize_phoenix.DIkmdRAn_Z1hfHjM.webp)\\n\\n### Weights and Biases (W&B) Weave\\n\\n[Section titled “Weights and Biases (W&B) Weave”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#weights-and-biases-wb-weave)\\n\\n[W&B Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/) is a framework for tracking, experimenting with, evaluating, deploying, and improving LLM applications. Designed for scalability and flexibility, Weave supports every stage of your application development workflow.\\n\\n#### Usage Pattern\\n\\n[Section titled “Usage Pattern”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#usage-pattern-2)\\n\\nThe integration leverages LlamaIndex’s [`instrumentation` module](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability/instrumentation) to register spans/events as Weave calls. By default, Weave automatically patches and tracks calls to [common LLM libraries and frameworks](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/).\\n\\nInstall the `weave` library:\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\nGet a W&B API Key:\\n\\nIf you don’t already have a W&B account, create one by visiting [https://wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai/) and copy your API key from [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize). When prompted to authenticate, enter the API key.\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\n![weave quickstart](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/_astro/weave_quickstart.CvSXnjaM_ZRbWOo.webp)\\n\\nTraces include execution time, token usage, cost, inputs/outputs, errors, nested operations, and streaming data. If you are new to Weave tracing, learn more about how to navigate it [here](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/trace-tree).\\n\\nIf you have a custom function which is not traced, decorate it with [`@weave.op()`](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/ops).\\n\\nYou can also control the patching behavior using the `autopatch_settings` argument in `weave.init`. For example if you don’t want to trace a library/framework you can turn it off like this:\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\nNo additional LlamaIndex configuration is required; tracing begins once `weave.init()` is called.\\n\\n#### Guides\\n\\n[Section titled “Guides”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#guides-1)\\n\\nThe integration with LlamaIndex supports almost every component of LlamaIndex — streaming/async, completions, chat, tool calling, agents, workflows, and RAG support.

If you are new to Weave tracing, learn more about how to navigate it [here](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/trace-tree).\\n\\nIf you have a custom function which is not traced, decorate it with [`@weave.op()`](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/ops).\\n\\nYou can also control the patching behavior using the `autopatch_settings` argument in `weave.init`. For example if you don’t want to trace a library/framework you can turn it off like this:\\n\\n```\\n\\n```\\n\\nNo additional LlamaIndex configuration is required; tracing begins once `weave.init()` is called.\\n\\n#### Guides\\n\\n[Section titled “Guides”](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability#guides-1)\\n\\nThe integration with LlamaIndex supports almost every component of LlamaIndex — streaming/async, completions, chat, tool calling, agents, workflows, and RAG support.

They feature lower costs, higher multilingual performance, and new parameters to control the overall size.\\n\\n## What are embeddings?\\n\\nOpenAI’s text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. Embeddings are commonly used for:\\n\\n- **Search** (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)\\n- **Clustering** (where text strings are grouped by similarity)\\n- **Recommendations** (where items with related text strings are recommended)\\n- **Anomaly detection** (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)\\n- **Diversity measurement** (where similarity distributions are analyzed)\\n- **Classification** (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)\\n\\nAn embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The [distance](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#which-distance-function-should-i-use) between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.\\n\\nVisit our [pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) to learn about embeddings pricing. Requests are billed based on the number of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) in the [input](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create#embeddings/create-input).\\n\\n## How to get embeddings\\n\\nTo get an embedding, send your text string to the [embeddings API endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings) along with the embedding model name (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`):\\n\\nExample: Getting embeddings\\n\\njavascript\\n\\n```javascript\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nimport OpenAI from \\\"openai\\\";\\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\\n\\nconst embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({\\n  model: \\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\",\\n  input: \\\"Your text string goes here\\\",\\n  encoding_format: \\\"float\\\",\\n});\\n\\nconsole.log(embedding);\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\\n    input=\\\"Your text string goes here\\\",\\n    model=\\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\"\\n)\\n\\nprint(response.data[0].embedding)\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -d '{\\n    \\\"input\\\": \\\"Your text string goes here\\\",\\n    \\\"model\\\": \\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\"\\n  }'\\n```\\n\\nThe response contains the embedding vector (list of floating point numbers) along with some additional metadata. You can extract the embedding vector, save it in a vector database, and use for many different use cases.\\n\\n```json\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n{\\n  \\\"object\\\": \\\"list\\\",\\n  \\\"data\\\": [\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\n      \\\"object\\\": \\\"embedding\\\",\\\\\\n      \\\"index\\\": 0,\\\\\\n      \\\"embedding\\\": [\\\\\\n        -0.006929283495992422,\\\\\\n        -0.005336422007530928,\\\\\\n        -4.547132266452536e-05,\\\\\\n        -0.024047505110502243\\\\\\n      ],\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\n  ],\\n  \\\"model\\\": \\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\",\\n  \\\"usage\\\": {\\n    \\\"prompt_tokens\\\": 5,\\n    \\\"total_tokens\\\": 5\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBy default, the length of the embedding vector is `1536` for `text-embedding-3-small` or `3072` for `text-embedding-3-large`. To reduce the embedding's dimensions without losing its concept-representing properties, pass in the [dimensions parameter](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create#embeddings-create-dimensions). Find more detail on embedding dimensions in the [embedding use case section](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#use-cases).\\n\\n## Embedding models\\n\\nOpenAI offers two powerful third-generation embedding model (denoted by `-3` in the model ID). Read the embedding v3 [announcement blog post](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) for more details.\\n\\nUsage is priced per input token. Below is an example of pricing pages of text per US dollar (assuming ~800 tokens per page):\\n\\n| Model | ~ Pages per dollar | Performance on [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) eval | Max input |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| text-embedding-3-small | 62,500 | 62.3% | 8192 |\\n| text-embedding-3-large | 9,615 | 64.6% | 8192 |\\n| text-embedding-ada-002 | 12,500 | 61.0% | 8192 |\\n\\n## Use cases\\n\\nHere we show some representative use cases, using the [Amazon fine-food reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).\\n\\n### Obtaining the embeddings\\n\\nThe dataset contains a total of 568,454 food reviews left by Amazon users up to October 2012. We use a subset of the 1000 most recent reviews for illustration purposes. The reviews are in English and tend to be positive or negative. Each review has a `ProductId`, `UserId`, `Score`, review title ( `Summary`) and review body ( `Text`). For example:\\n\\n| Product Id | User Id | Score | Summary | Text |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| B001E4KFG0 | A3SGXH7AUHU8GW | 5 | Good Quality Dog Food | I have bought several of the Vitality canned... |\\n| B00813GRG4 | A1D87F6ZCVE5NK | 1 | Not as Advertised | Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanut... |\\n\\nBelow, we combine the review summary and review text into a single combined text. The model encodes this combined text and output a single vector embedding.\\n\\n[Get\\\\_embeddings\\\\_from\\\\_dataset.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/get_embeddings_from_dataset)\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\ndef get_embedding(text, model=\\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\"):\\n    text = text.replace(\\\"\\\\n\\\", \\\" \\\")\\n    return client.embeddings.create(input = [text], model=model).data[0].embedding\\n\\ndf['ada_embedding'] = df.combined.apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, model='text-embedding-3-small'))\\ndf.to_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv', index=False)\\n```\\n\\nTo load the data from a saved file, you can run the following:\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\ndf = pd.read_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv')\\ndf['ada_embedding'] = df.ada_embedding.apply(eval).apply(np.array)\\n```\\n\\nReducing embedding dimensions\\n\\nUsing larger embeddings, for example storing them in a vector store for retrieval, generally costs more and consumes more compute, memory and storage than using smaller embeddings.\\n\\nBoth of our new embedding models were trained [with a technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147) that allows developers to trade-off performance and cost of using embeddings. Specifically, developers can shorten embeddings (i.e. remove some numbers from the end of the sequence) without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties by passing in the [`dimensions` API parameter](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create#embeddings-create-dimensions). For example, on the MTEB benchmark, a `text-embedding-3-large` embedding can be shortened to a size of 256 while still outperforming an unshortened `text-embedding-ada-002` embedding with a size of 1536. You can read more about how changing the dimensions impacts performance in our [embeddings v3 launch blog post](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates#:~:text=Native%20support%20for%20shortening%20embeddings).\\n\\nIn general, using the `dimensions` parameter when creating the embedding is the suggested approach. In certain cases, you may need to change the embedding dimension after you generate it. When you change the dimension manually, you need to be sure to normalize the dimensions of the embedding as is shown below.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\ndef normalize_l2(x):\\n    x = np.array(x)\\n    if x.ndim == 1:\\n        norm = np.linalg.norm(x)\\n        if norm == 0:\\n            return x\\n        return x / norm\\n    else:\\n        norm = np.linalg.norm(x, 2, axis=1, keepdims=True)\\n        return np.where(norm == 0, x, x / norm)\\n\\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\\n    model=\\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\", input=\\\"Testing 123\\\", encoding_format=\\\"float\\\"\\n)\\n\\ncut_dim = response.data[0].embedding[:256]\\nnorm_dim = normalize_l2(cut_dim)\\n\\nprint(norm_dim)\\n```\\n\\nDynamically changing the dimensions enables very flexible usage. For example, when using a vector data store that only supports embeddings up to 1024 dimensions long, developers can now still use our best embedding model `text-embedding-3-large` and specify a value of 1024 for the `dimensions` API parameter, which will shorten the embedding down from 3072 dimensions, trading off some accuracy in exchange for the smaller vector size.\\n\\nQuestion answering using embeddings-based search\\n\\n[Question\\\\_answering\\\\_using\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/question_answering_using_embeddings)\\n\\nThere are many common cases where the model is not trained on data which contains key facts and information you want to make accessible when generating responses to a user query. One way of solving this, as shown below, is to put additional information into the context window of the model. This is effective in many use cases but leads to higher token costs. In this notebook, we explore the tradeoff between this approach and embeddings bases search.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\nquery = f\\\"\\\"\\\"Use the below article on the 2022 Winter Olympics to answer the subsequent question.

Then we calculate cosine similarity between the resulting query embedding and each of the function embeddings. The highest cosine similarity results are most relevant.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\nfrom openai.embeddings_utils import get_embedding, cosine_similarity\\n\\ndf['code_embedding'] = df['code'].apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, model='text-embedding-3-small'))\\n\\ndef search_functions(df, code_query, n=3, pprint=True, n_lines=7):\\n    embedding = get_embedding(code_query, model='text-embedding-3-small')\\n    df['similarities'] = df.code_embedding.apply(lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, embedding))\\n\\n    res = df.sort_values('similarities', ascending=False).head(n)\\n    return res\\n\\nres = search_functions(df, 'Completions API tests', n=3)\\n```\\n\\nRecommendations using embeddings\\n\\n[Recommendation\\\\_using\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/recommendation_using_embeddings)\\n\\nBecause shorter distances between embedding vectors represent greater similarity, embeddings can be useful for recommendation.\\n\\nBelow, we illustrate a basic recommender.

In order to visualize this high dimensional data we use the t-SNE algorithm to transform the data into two dimensions.\\n\\nWe color the individual reviews based on the star rating which the reviewer has given:\\n\\n- 1-star: red\\n- 2-star: dark orange\\n- 3-star: gold\\n- 4-star: turquoise\\n- 5-star: dark green\\n\\n![Amazon ratings visualized in language using t-SNE](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/embeddings-tsne.png)\\n\\nThe visualization seems to have produced roughly 3 clusters, one of which has mostly negative reviews.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport matplotlib\\n\\ndf = pd.read_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv')\\nmatrix = df.ada_embedding.apply(eval).to_list()\\n\\n# Create a t-SNE model and transform the data\\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=15, random_state=42, init='random', learning_rate=200)\\nvis_dims = tsne.fit_transform(matrix)\\n\\ncolors = [\\\"red\\\", \\\"darkorange\\\", \\\"gold\\\", \\\"turquiose\\\", \\\"darkgreen\\\"]\\nx = [x for x,y in vis_dims]\\ny = [y for x,y in vis_dims]\\ncolor_indices = df.Score.values - 1\\n\\ncolormap = matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap(colors)\\nplt.scatter(x, y, c=color_indices, cmap=colormap, alpha=0.3)\\nplt.title(\\\"Amazon ratings visualized in language using t-SNE\\\")\\n```\\n\\nEmbedding as a text feature encoder for ML algorithms\\n\\n[Regression\\\\_using\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/regression_using_embeddings)\\n\\nAn embedding can be used as a general free-text feature encoder within a machine learning model. Incorporating embeddings will improve the performance of any machine learning model, if some of the relevant inputs are free text. An embedding can also be used as a categorical feature encoder within a ML model. This adds most value if the names of categorical variables are meaningful and numerous, such as job titles. Similarity embeddings generally perform better than search embeddings for this task.\\n\\nWe observed that generally the embedding representation is very rich and information dense. For example, reducing the dimensionality of the inputs using SVD or PCA, even by 10%, generally results in worse downstream performance on specific tasks.\\n\\nThis code splits the data into a training set and a testing set, which will be used by the following two use cases, namely regression and classification.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\n\\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\\n    list(df.ada_embedding.values),\\n    df.Score,\\n    test_size = 0.2,\\n    random_state=42\\n)\\n```\\n\\n#### Regression using the embedding features\\n\\nEmbeddings present an elegant way of predicting a numerical value. In this example we predict the reviewer’s star rating, based on the text of their review. Because the semantic information contained within embeddings is high, the prediction is decent even with very few reviews.\\n\\nWe assume the score is a continuous variable between 1 and 5, and allow the algorithm to predict any floating point value. The ML algorithm minimizes the distance of the predicted value to the true score, and achieves a mean absolute error of 0.39, which means that on average the prediction is off by less than half a star.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\\n\\nrfr = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)\\nrfr.fit(X_train, y_train)\\npreds = rfr.predict(X_test)\\n```\\n\\nClassification using the embedding features\\n\\n[Classification\\\\_using\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/classification_using_embeddings)\\n\\nThis time, instead of having the algorithm predict a value anywhere between 1 and 5, we will attempt to classify the exact number of stars for a review into 5 buckets, ranging from 1 to 5 stars.\\n\\nAfter the training, the model learns to predict 1 and 5-star reviews much better than the more nuanced reviews (2-4 stars), likely due to more extreme sentiment expression.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\\n\\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)\\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\\npreds = clf.predict(X_test)\\n```\\n\\nZero-shot classification\\n\\n[Zero-shot\\\\_classification\\\\_with\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/zero-shot_classification_with_embeddings)\\n\\nWe can use embeddings for zero shot classification without any labeled training data. For each class, we embed the class name or a short description of the class. To classify some new text in a zero-shot manner, we compare its embedding to all class embeddings and predict the class with the highest similarity.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\nfrom openai.embeddings_utils import cosine_similarity, get_embedding\\n\\ndf= df[df.Score!=3]\\ndf['sentiment'] = df.Score.replace({1:'negative', 2:'negative', 4:'positive', 5:'positive'})\\n\\nlabels = ['negative', 'positive']\\nlabel_embeddings = [get_embedding(label, model=model) for label in labels]\\n\\ndef label_score(review_embedding, label_embeddings):\\n    return cosine_similarity(review_embedding, label_embeddings[1]) - cosine_similarity(review_embedding, label_embeddings[0])\\n\\nprediction = 'positive' if label_score('Sample Review', label_embeddings) > 0 else 'negative'\\n```\\n\\nObtaining user and product embeddings for cold-start recommendation\\n\\n[User\\\\_and\\\\_product\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/user_and_product_embeddings)\\n\\nWe can obtain a user embedding by averaging over all of their reviews. Similarly, we can obtain a product embedding by averaging over all the reviews about that product. In order to showcase the usefulness of this approach we use a subset of 50k reviews to cover more reviews per user and per product.\\n\\nWe evaluate the usefulness of these embeddings on a separate test set, where we plot similarity of the user and product embedding as a function of the rating. Interestingly, based on this approach, even before the user receives the product we can predict better than random whether they would like the product.\\n\\n![Boxplot grouped by Score](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/embeddings-boxplot.png)\\n\\n```python\\nuser_embeddings = df.groupby('UserId').ada_embedding.apply(np.mean)\\nprod_embeddings = df.groupby('ProductId').ada_embedding.apply(np.mean)\\n```\\n\\nClustering\\n\\n[Clustering.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/clustering)\\n\\nClustering is one way of making sense of a large volume of textual data. Embeddings are useful for this task, as they provide semantically meaningful vector representations of each text. Thus, in an unsupervised way, clustering will uncover hidden groupings in our dataset.\\n\\nIn this example, we discover four distinct clusters: one focusing on dog food, one on negative reviews, and two on positive reviews.\\n\\n![Clusters identified visualized in language 2d using t-SNE](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/embeddings-cluster.png)\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\\n\\nmatrix = np.vstack(df.ada_embedding.values)\\nn_clusters = 4\\n\\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = n_clusters, init='k-means++', random_state=42)\\nkmeans.fit(matrix)\\ndf['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_\\n```\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### How can I tell how many tokens a string has before I embed it?\\n\\nIn Python, you can split a string into tokens with OpenAI's tokenizer [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken).\\n\\nExample code:\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nimport tiktoken\\n\\ndef num_tokens_from_string(string: str, encoding_name: str) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Returns the number of tokens in a text string.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding(encoding_name)\\n    num_tokens = len(encoding.encode(string))\\n    return num_tokens\\n\\nnum_tokens_from_string(\\\"tiktoken is great!\\\", \\\"cl100k_base\\\")\\n```\\n\\nFor third-generation embedding models like `text-embedding-3-small`, use the `cl100k_base` encoding.\\n\\nMore details and example code are in the OpenAI Cookbook guide [how to count tokens with tiktoken](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken).\\n\\n### How can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\\n\\nFor searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database. You can find examples of working with vector databases and the OpenAI API [in our Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/vector_databases/readme) on GitHub.\\n\\n### Which distance function should I use?\\n\\nWe recommend [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). The choice of distance function typically doesn't matter much.\\n\\nOpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\\n\\n- Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\\n- Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in the identical rankings\\n\\n### Can I share my embeddings online?\\n\\nYes, customers own their input and output from our models, including in the case of embeddings. You are responsible for ensuring that the content you input to our API does not violate any applicable law or our [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).\\n\\n### Do V3 embedding models know about recent events?\\n\\nNo, the `text-embedding-3-large` and `text-embedding-3-small` models lack knowledge of events that occurred after September 2021. This is generally not as much of a limitation as it would be for text generation models but in certain edge cases it can reduce performance.\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"ogTitle\": \"Vector embeddings - OpenAI API\",\n    \"ogUrl\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n    \"twitter:description\": \"Learn how to turn text into numbers, unlocking use cases like search, clustering, and more with OpenAI API embeddings.\",\n    \"og:description\": \"Learn how to turn text into numbers, unlocking use cases like search, clustering, and more with OpenAI API embeddings.\",\n    \"twitter:domain\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogDescription\": \"Learn how to turn text into numbers, unlocking use cases like search, clustering, and more with OpenAI API embeddings.\",\n    \"og:title\": \"Vector embeddings - OpenAI API\",\n    \"og:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"twitter:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\n    \"description\": \"Learn how to turn text into numbers, unlocking use cases like search, clustering, and more with OpenAI API embeddings.\",\n    \"favicon\": \"https://platform.openai.com/favicon-platform.png\",\n    \"og:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n    \"og:type\": \"website\",\n    \"twitter:title\": \"Vector embeddings - OpenAI API\",\n    \"theme-color\": \"#000000\",\n    \"title\": \"Vector embeddings - OpenAI API\",\n    \"twitter:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"scrapeId\": \"a9b08a03-0c2d-486d-b438-00d85007cab2\",\n    \"sourceURL\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings\",\n    \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n    \"proxyUsed\": \"basic\",\n    \"cacheState\": \"hit\",\n    \"cachedAt\": \"2025-10-02T23:11:16.408Z\",\n    \"creditsUsed\": 1\n  }\n}"}]}]},"uuid":"d72c939b-3300-4b3b-9ad0-d3ad3ab5882d","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:34:03.083Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"{\n  \"markdown\": \"Log in [Sign up](https://platform.openai.com/signup)\\n\\n# Vector embeddings\\n\\nLearn how to turn text into numbers, unlocking use cases like search.\\n\\nCopy page\\n\\nNew embedding models\\n\\n`text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large`, our newest and most performant embedding models, are now available.

Embeddings are commonly used for:\\n\\n- **Search** (where results are ranked by relevance to a query string)\\n- **Clustering** (where text strings are grouped by similarity)\\n- **Recommendations** (where items with related text strings are recommended)\\n- **Anomaly detection** (where outliers with little relatedness are identified)\\n- **Diversity measurement** (where similarity distributions are analyzed)\\n- **Classification** (where text strings are classified by their most similar label)\\n\\nAn embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The [distance](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#which-distance-function-should-i-use) between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.\\n\\nVisit our [pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) to learn about embeddings pricing. Requests are billed based on the number of [tokens](https://platform.openai.com/tokenizer) in the [input](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create#embeddings/create-input).\\n\\n## How to get embeddings\\n\\nTo get an embedding, send your text string to the [embeddings API endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings) along with the embedding model name (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`):\\n\\nExample: Getting embeddings\\n\\njavascript\\n\\n```javascript\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nimport OpenAI from \\\"openai\\\";\\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\\n\\nconst embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({\\n  model: \\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\",\\n  input: \\\"Your text string goes here\\\",\\n  encoding_format: \\\"float\\\",\\n});\\n\\nconsole.log(embedding);\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\\n    input=\\\"Your text string goes here\\\",\\n    model=\\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\"\\n)\\n\\nprint(response.data[0].embedding)\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -d '{\\n    \\\"input\\\": \\\"Your text string goes here\\\",\\n    \\\"model\\\": \\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\"\\n  }'\\n```\\n\\nThe response contains the embedding vector (list of floating point numbers) along with some additional metadata. You can extract the embedding vector, save it in a vector database, and use for many different use cases.\\n\\n```json\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n{\\n  \\\"object\\\": \\\"list\\\",\\n  \\\"data\\\": [\\\\\\n    {\\\\\\n      \\\"object\\\": \\\"embedding\\\",\\\\\\n      \\\"index\\\": 0,\\\\\\n      \\\"embedding\\\": [\\\\\\n        -0.006929283495992422,\\\\\\n        -0.005336422007530928,\\\\\\n        -4.547132266452536e-05,\\\\\\n        -0.024047505110502243\\\\\\n      ],\\\\\\n    }\\\\\\n  ],\\n  \\\"model\\\": \\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\",\\n  \\\"usage\\\": {\\n    \\\"prompt_tokens\\\": 5,\\n    \\\"total_tokens\\\": 5\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBy default, the length of the embedding vector is `1536` for `text-embedding-3-small` or `3072` for `text-embedding-3-large`. To reduce the embedding's dimensions without losing its concept-representing properties, pass in the [dimensions parameter](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create#embeddings-create-dimensions). Find more detail on embedding dimensions in the [embedding use case section](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#use-cases).\\n\\n## Embedding models\\n\\nOpenAI offers two powerful third-generation embedding model (denoted by `-3` in the model ID). Read the embedding v3 [announcement blog post](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates) for more details.\\n\\nUsage is priced per input token. Below is an example of pricing pages of text per US dollar (assuming ~800 tokens per page):\\n\\n| Model | ~ Pages per dollar | Performance on [MTEB](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) eval | Max input |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| text-embedding-3-small | 62,500 | 62.3% | 8192 |\\n| text-embedding-3-large | 9,615 | 64.6% | 8192 |\\n| text-embedding-ada-002 | 12,500 | 61.0% | 8192 |\\n\\n## Use cases\\n\\nHere we show some representative use cases, using the [Amazon fine-food reviews dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews).\\n\\n### Obtaining the embeddings\\n\\nThe dataset contains a total of 568,454 food reviews left by Amazon users up to October 2012. We use a subset of the 1000 most recent reviews for illustration purposes. The reviews are in English and tend to be positive or negative. Each review has a `ProductId`, `UserId`, `Score`, review title ( `Summary`) and review body ( `Text`). For example:\\n\\n| Product Id | User Id | Score | Summary | Text |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| B001E4KFG0 | A3SGXH7AUHU8GW | 5 | Good Quality Dog Food | I have bought several of the Vitality canned... |\\n| B00813GRG4 | A1D87F6ZCVE5NK | 1 | Not as Advertised | Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanut... |\\n\\nBelow, we combine the review summary and review text into a single combined text. The model encodes this combined text and output a single vector embedding.\\n\\n[Get\\\\_embeddings\\\\_from\\\\_dataset.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/get_embeddings_from_dataset)\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\ndef get_embedding(text, model=\\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\"):\\n    text = text.replace(\\\"\\\\n\\\", \\\" \\\")\\n    return client.embeddings.create(input = [text], model=model).data[0].embedding\\n\\ndf['ada_embedding'] = df.combined.apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, model='text-embedding-3-small'))\\ndf.to_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv', index=False)\\n```\\n\\nTo load the data from a saved file, you can run the following:\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\ndf = pd.read_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv')\\ndf['ada_embedding'] = df.ada_embedding.apply(eval).apply(np.array)\\n```\\n\\nReducing embedding dimensions\\n\\nUsing larger embeddings, for example storing them in a vector store for retrieval, generally costs more and consumes more compute, memory and storage than using smaller embeddings.\\n\\nBoth of our new embedding models were trained [with a technique](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13147) that allows developers to trade-off performance and cost of using embeddings. Specifically, developers can shorten embeddings (i.e. remove some numbers from the end of the sequence) without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties by passing in the [`dimensions` API parameter](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings/create#embeddings-create-dimensions). For example, on the MTEB benchmark, a `text-embedding-3-large` embedding can be shortened to a size of 256 while still outperforming an unshortened `text-embedding-ada-002` embedding with a size of 1536. You can read more about how changing the dimensions impacts performance in our [embeddings v3 launch blog post](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates#:~:text=Native%20support%20for%20shortening%20embeddings).\\n\\nIn general, using the `dimensions` parameter when creating the embedding is the suggested approach. In certain cases, you may need to change the embedding dimension after you generate it. When you change the dimension manually, you need to be sure to normalize the dimensions of the embedding as is shown below.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\n21\\n22\\n23\\n24\\n25\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\ndef normalize_l2(x):\\n    x = np.array(x)\\n    if x.ndim == 1:\\n        norm = np.linalg.norm(x)\\n        if norm == 0:\\n            return x\\n        return x / norm\\n    else:\\n        norm = np.linalg.norm(x, 2, axis=1, keepdims=True)\\n        return np.where(norm == 0, x, x / norm)\\n\\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\\n    model=\\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\", input=\\\"Testing 123\\\", encoding_format=\\\"float\\\"\\n)\\n\\ncut_dim = response.data[0].embedding[:256]\\nnorm_dim = normalize_l2(cut_dim)\\n\\nprint(norm_dim)\\n```\\n\\nDynamically changing the dimensions enables very flexible usage. For example, when using a vector data store that only supports embeddings up to 1024 dimensions long, developers can now still use our best embedding model `text-embedding-3-large` and specify a value of 1024 for the `dimensions` API parameter, which will shorten the embedding down from 3072 dimensions, trading off some accuracy in exchange for the smaller vector size.\\n\\nQuestion answering using embeddings-based search\\n\\n[Question\\\\_answering\\\\_using\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/question_answering_using_embeddings)\\n\\nThere are many common cases where the model is not trained on data which contains key facts and information you want to make accessible when generating responses to a user query.

Then we calculate cosine similarity between the resulting query embedding and each of the function embeddings. The highest cosine similarity results are most relevant.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\nfrom openai.embeddings_utils import get_embedding, cosine_similarity\\n\\ndf['code_embedding'] = df['code'].apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, model='text-embedding-3-small'))\\n\\ndef search_functions(df, code_query, n=3, pprint=True, n_lines=7):\\n    embedding = get_embedding(code_query, model='text-embedding-3-small')\\n    df['similarities'] = df.code_embedding.apply(lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, embedding))\\n\\n    res = df.sort_values('similarities', ascending=False).head(n)\\n    return res\\n\\nres = search_functions(df, 'Completions API tests', n=3)\\n```\\n\\nRecommendations using embeddings\\n\\n[Recommendation\\\\_using\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/recommendation_using_embeddings)\\n\\nBecause shorter distances between embedding vectors represent greater similarity, embeddings can be useful for recommendation.\\n\\nBelow, we illustrate a basic recommender. It takes in a list of strings and one 'source' string, computes their embeddings, and then returns a ranking of the strings, ranked from most similar to least similar. As a concrete example, the linked notebook below applies a version of this function to the [AG news dataset](http://groups.di.unipi.it/~gulli/AG_corpus_of_news_articles.html) (sampled down to 2,000 news article descriptions) to return the top 5 most similar articles to any given source article.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\ndef recommendations_from_strings(\\n    strings: List[str],\\n    index_of_source_string: int,\\n    model=\\\"text-embedding-3-small\\\",\\n) -> List[int]:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Return nearest neighbors of a given string.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    # get embeddings for all strings\\n    embeddings = [embedding_from_string(string, model=model) for string in strings]\\n\\n    # get the embedding of the source string\\n    query_embedding = embeddings[index_of_source_string]\\n\\n    # get distances between the source embedding and other embeddings (function from embeddings_utils.py)\\n    distances = distances_from_embeddings(query_embedding, embeddings, distance_metric=\\\"cosine\\\")\\n\\n    # get indices of nearest neighbors (function from embeddings_utils.py)\\n    indices_of_nearest_neighbors = indices_of_nearest_neighbors_from_distances(distances)\\n    return indices_of_nearest_neighbors\\n```\\n\\nData visualization in 2D\\n\\n[Visualizing\\\\_embeddings\\\\_in\\\\_2D.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/visualizing_embeddings_in_2d)\\n\\nThe size of the embeddings varies with the complexity of the underlying model. In order to visualize this high dimensional data we use the t-SNE algorithm to transform the data into two dimensions.\\n\\nWe color the individual reviews based on the star rating which the reviewer has given:\\n\\n- 1-star: red\\n- 2-star: dark orange\\n- 3-star: gold\\n- 4-star: turquoise\\n- 5-star: dark green\\n\\n![Amazon ratings visualized in language using t-SNE](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/embeddings-tsne.png)\\n\\nThe visualization seems to have produced roughly 3 clusters, one of which has mostly negative reviews.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n13\\n14\\n15\\n16\\n17\\n18\\n19\\n20\\nimport pandas as pd\\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport matplotlib\\n\\ndf = pd.read_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv')\\nmatrix = df.ada_embedding.apply(eval).to_list()\\n\\n# Create a t-SNE model and transform the data\\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=15, random_state=42, init='random', learning_rate=200)\\nvis_dims = tsne.fit_transform(matrix)\\n\\ncolors = [\\\"red\\\", \\\"darkorange\\\", \\\"gold\\\", \\\"turquiose\\\", \\\"darkgreen\\\"]\\nx = [x for x,y in vis_dims]\\ny = [y for x,y in vis_dims]\\ncolor_indices = df.Score.values - 1\\n\\ncolormap = matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap(colors)\\nplt.scatter(x, y, c=color_indices, cmap=colormap, alpha=0.3)\\nplt.title(\\\"Amazon ratings visualized in language using t-SNE\\\")\\n```\\n\\nEmbedding as a text feature encoder for ML algorithms\\n\\n[Regression\\\\_using\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/regression_using_embeddings)\\n\\nAn embedding can be used as a general free-text feature encoder within a machine learning model. Incorporating embeddings will improve the performance of any machine learning model, if some of the relevant inputs are free text. An embedding can also be used as a categorical feature encoder within a ML model. This adds most value if the names of categorical variables are meaningful and numerous, such as job titles. Similarity embeddings generally perform better than search embeddings for this task.\\n\\nWe observed that generally the embedding representation is very rich and information dense. For example, reducing the dimensionality of the inputs using SVD or PCA, even by 10%, generally results in worse downstream performance on specific tasks.\\n\\nThis code splits the data into a training set and a testing set, which will be used by the following two use cases, namely regression and classification.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\\n\\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\\n    list(df.ada_embedding.values),\\n    df.Score,\\n    test_size = 0.2,\\n    random_state=42\\n)\\n```\\n\\n#### Regression using the embedding features\\n\\nEmbeddings present an elegant way of predicting a numerical value. In this example we predict the reviewer’s star rating, based on the text of their review. Because the semantic information contained within embeddings is high, the prediction is decent even with very few reviews.\\n\\nWe assume the score is a continuous variable between 1 and 5, and allow the algorithm to predict any floating point value. The ML algorithm minimizes the distance of the predicted value to the true score, and achieves a mean absolute error of 0.39, which means that on average the prediction is off by less than half a star.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\\n\\nrfr = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)\\nrfr.fit(X_train, y_train)\\npreds = rfr.predict(X_test)\\n```\\n\\nClassification using the embedding features\\n\\n[Classification\\\\_using\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/classification_using_embeddings)\\n\\nThis time, instead of having the algorithm predict a value anywhere between 1 and 5, we will attempt to classify the exact number of stars for a review into 5 buckets, ranging from 1 to 5 stars.\\n\\nAfter the training, the model learns to predict 1 and 5-star reviews much better than the more nuanced reviews (2-4 stars), likely due to more extreme sentiment expression.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\\n\\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)\\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\\npreds = clf.predict(X_test)\\n```\\n\\nZero-shot classification\\n\\n[Zero-shot\\\\_classification\\\\_with\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/zero-shot_classification_with_embeddings)\\n\\nWe can use embeddings for zero shot classification without any labeled training data. For each class, we embed the class name or a short description of the class. To classify some new text in a zero-shot manner, we compare its embedding to all class embeddings and predict the class with the highest similarity.\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\nfrom openai.embeddings_utils import cosine_similarity, get_embedding\\n\\ndf= df[df.Score!=3]\\ndf['sentiment'] = df.Score.replace({1:'negative', 2:'negative', 4:'positive', 5:'positive'})\\n\\nlabels = ['negative', 'positive']\\nlabel_embeddings = [get_embedding(label, model=model) for label in labels]\\n\\ndef label_score(review_embedding, label_embeddings):\\n    return cosine_similarity(review_embedding, label_embeddings[1]) - cosine_similarity(review_embedding, label_embeddings[0])\\n\\nprediction = 'positive' if label_score('Sample Review', label_embeddings) > 0 else 'negative'\\n```\\n\\nObtaining user and product embeddings for cold-start recommendation\\n\\n[User\\\\_and\\\\_product\\\\_embeddings.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/user_and_product_embeddings)\\n\\nWe can obtain a user embedding by averaging over all of their reviews. Similarly, we can obtain a product embedding by averaging over all the reviews about that product. In order to showcase the usefulness of this approach we use a subset of 50k reviews to cover more reviews per user and per product.\\n\\nWe evaluate the usefulness of these embeddings on a separate test set, where we plot similarity of the user and product embedding as a function of the rating. Interestingly, based on this approach, even before the user receives the product we can predict better than random whether they would like the product.\\n\\n![Boxplot grouped by Score](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/embeddings-boxplot.png)\\n\\n```python\\nuser_embeddings = df.groupby('UserId').ada_embedding.apply(np.mean)\\nprod_embeddings = df.groupby('ProductId').ada_embedding.apply(np.mean)\\n```\\n\\nClustering\\n\\n[Clustering.ipynb](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/clustering)\\n\\nClustering is one way of making sense of a large volume of textual data. Embeddings are useful for this task, as they provide semantically meaningful vector representations of each text. Thus, in an unsupervised way, clustering will uncover hidden groupings in our dataset.\\n\\nIn this example, we discover four distinct clusters: one focusing on dog food, one on negative reviews, and two on positive reviews.\\n\\n![Clusters identified visualized in language 2d using t-SNE](https://cdn.openai.com/API/docs/images/embeddings-cluster.png)\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\\n\\nmatrix = np.vstack(df.ada_embedding.values)\\nn_clusters = 4\\n\\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters = n_clusters, init='k-means++', random_state=42)\\nkmeans.fit(matrix)\\ndf['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_\\n```\\n\\n## FAQ\\n\\n### How can I tell how many tokens a string has before I embed it?\\n\\nIn Python, you can split a string into tokens with OpenAI's tokenizer [`tiktoken`](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken).\\n\\nExample code:\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nimport tiktoken\\n\\ndef num_tokens_from_string(string: str, encoding_name: str) -> int:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Returns the number of tokens in a text string.\\\"\\\"\\\"\\n    encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding(encoding_name)\\n    num_tokens = len(encoding.encode(string))\\n    return num_tokens\\n\\nnum_tokens_from_string(\\\"tiktoken is great!\\\", \\\"cl100k_base\\\")\\n```\\n\\nFor third-generation embedding models like `text-embedding-3-small`, use the `cl100k_base` encoding.\\n\\nMore details and example code are in the OpenAI Cookbook guide [how to count tokens with tiktoken](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_count_tokens_with_tiktoken).\\n\\n### How can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\\n\\nFor searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database. You can find examples of working with vector databases and the OpenAI API [in our Cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/vector_databases/readme) on GitHub.\\n\\n### Which distance function should I use?\\n\\nWe recommend [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). The choice of distance function typically doesn't matter much.\\n\\nOpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\\n\\n- Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\\n- Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in the identical rankings\\n\\n### Can I share my embeddings online?\\n\\nYes, customers own their input and output from our models, including in the case of embeddings. You are responsible for ensuring that the content you input to our API does not violate any applicable law or our [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use).\\n\\n### Do V3 embedding models know about recent events?\\n\\nNo, the `text-embedding-3-large` and `text-embedding-3-small` models lack knowledge of events that occurred after September 2021. This is generally not as much of a limitation as it would be for text generation models but in certain edge cases it can reduce performance.\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"ogTitle\": \"Vector embeddings - OpenAI API\",\n    \"ogUrl\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n    \"twitter:description\": \"Learn how to turn text into numbers, unlocking use cases like search, clustering, and more with OpenAI API embeddings.\",\n    \"og:description\": \"Learn how to turn text into numbers, unlocking use cases like search, clustering, and more with OpenAI API embeddings.\",\n    \"twitter:domain\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogDescription\": \"Learn how to turn text into numbers, unlocking use cases like search, clustering, and more with OpenAI API embeddings.\",\n    \"og:title\": \"Vector embeddings - OpenAI API\",\n    \"og:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"twitter:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\n    \"description\": \"Learn how to turn text into numbers, unlocking use cases like search, clustering, and more with OpenAI API embeddings.\",\n    \"favicon\": \"https://platform.openai.com/favicon-platform.png\",\n    \"og:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n    \"og:type\": \"website\",\n    \"twitter:title\": \"Vector embeddings - OpenAI API\",\n    \"theme-color\": \"#000000\",\n    \"title\": \"Vector embeddings - OpenAI API\",\n    \"twitter:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"scrapeId\": \"a9b08a03-0c2d-486d-b438-00d85007cab2\",\n    \"sourceURL\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings\",\n    \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n    \"proxyUsed\": \"basic\",\n    \"cacheState\": \"hit\",\n    \"cachedAt\": \"2025-10-02T23:11:16.408Z\",\n    \"creditsUsed\": 1\n  }\n}"}]}

Take a look below for the full set of guides for each one!\n\n**NOTE:**\n\nObservability is now being handled via the [`instrumentation` module](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability/instrumentation) (available in v0.10.20 and later.)\n\nA lot of the tooling and integrations mentioned in this page use our legacy `CallbackManager` or don't use `set_global_handler`. We've marked these integrations as such!\n\n## Usage Pattern\n\nTo toggle, you will generally just need to do the following:\n\n```python\n# Set global handler\nset_global_handler(handler_name, **kwargs)\n```\n\nNote that all `kwargs` to `set_global_handler` are passed to the underlying callback handler.\n\nAnd that's it! Executions will get seamlessly piped to downstream service and you'll be able to access features such as viewing execution traces of your application.\n\n## Integrations\n\n### OpenTelemetry\n\n[OpenTelemetry](https://openetelemetry.io/) is a widely used open-source service for tracing and observability, with numerous backend integrations (such as Jaeger, Zipkin or Prometheus).\n\nOur OpenTelemetry integration traces all the events produced by pieces of LlamaIndex code, including LLMs, Agents, RAG pipeline components and many more: everything you would get out with LlamaIndex native instrumentation you can export in OpenTelemetry format!\n\nYou can install the library with:\n\n```bash\npip install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp\n```\n\nAnd can use it in your code with the default settings, as in this example with a RAG pipeline:\n\n```python\nfrom opentelemetry import trace\nfrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider\nfrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor\nfrom opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter\n\n# Set up OpenTelemetry\ntrace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())\ntracer_provider = trace.get_tracer_provider()\ntracer_provider.add_span_processor(\n    SimpleSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())\n)\n\n# Your LlamaIndex code here\n```\n\nOr you can use a more complex and customized set-up, such as in the following example:\n\n```python\n# Custom configuration example\n```\n\nWe also have a [demo repository](https://github.com/run-llama/agents-observability-demo) where we show how to trace agentic workflows and pipe the registered traces into a Postgres database.\n\n### LlamaTrace (Hosted Arize Phoenix)\n\nWe've partnered with Arize on [LlamaTrace](https://llamatrace.com/), a hosted tracing, observability, and evaluation platform that works natively with LlamaIndex open-source users and has integrations with LlamaCloud.\n\nThis is built upon the open-source Arize [Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) project. Phoenix provides a notebook-first experience for monitoring your models and LLM Applications by providing:\n\n- LLM Traces - Trace through the execution of your LLM Application to understand the internals of your LLM Application and to troubleshoot problems related to things like retrieval and tool execution.\n- LLM Evals - Leverage the power of large language models to evaluate your generative model or application's relevance, toxicity, and more.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\nTo install the integration package, do `pip install -U llama-index-callbacks-arize-phoenix`.\n\nThen create an account on LlamaTrace: [https://llamatrace.com/login](https://llamatrace.com/login). Create an API key and put it in the `PHOENIX_API_KEY` variable below.\n\nThen run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"PHOENIX_API_KEY\"] = \"your-api-key\"\n\nimport phoenix as px\npx.launch_app()\n\n# Set up LlamaIndex callback\nfrom llama_index.core import set_global_handler\nset_global_handler(\"arize_phoenix\")\n```\n\n### Weights and Biases (W&B) Weave\n\n[W&B Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/) is a framework for tracking, experimenting with, evaluating, deploying, and improving LLM applications. Designed for scalability and flexibility, Weave supports every stage of your application development workflow.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\nThe integration leverages LlamaIndex's [`instrumentation` module](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability/instrumentation) to register spans/events as Weave calls. By default, Weave automatically patches and tracks calls to [common LLM libraries and frameworks](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/).\n\nInstall the `weave` library:\n\n```bash\npip install weave\n```\n\nGet a W&B API Key:\n\nIf you don't already have a W&B account, create one by visiting [https://wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai/) and copy your API key from [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize). When prompted to authenticate, enter the API key.\n\n```python\nimport weave\nweave.init('project-name')\n```\n\nTraces include execution time, token usage, cost, inputs/outputs, errors, nested operations, and streaming data. If you are new to Weave tracing, learn more about how to navigate it [here](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/trace-tree).\n\nIf you have a custom function which is not traced, decorate it with [`@weave.op()`](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/ops).\n\nYou can also control the patching behavior using the `autopatch_settings` argument in `weave.init`. For example if you don't want to trace a library/framework you can turn it off like this:\n\n```python\nweave.init('project-name', autopatch_settings={'llamaindex': False})\n```\n\nNo additional LlamaIndex configuration is required; tracing begins once `weave.init()` is called.\n\n### MLflow\n\n[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) is an open-source MLOps/LLMOps platform, focuses on the full lifecycle for machine learning projects, ensuring that each phase is manageable, traceable, and reproducible.\n**MLflow Tracing** is an OpenTelemetry-based tracing capability and supports one-click instrumentation for LlamaIndex applications.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\nSince MLflow is open-source, you can start using it without any account creation or API key setup. Jump straight into the code after installing the MLflow package!\n\n```python\npip install mlflow\n\nimport mlflow\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog()\n\n# Your LlamaIndex code here\n```\n\n#### Support Table\n\nMLflow Tracing support the full range of LlamaIndex features. Some new features like [AgentWorkflow](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/introducing-agentworkflow-a-powerful-system-for-building-ai-agent-systems) requires MLflow >= 2.18.0.\n\n| Streaming | Async | Engine | Agents | Workflow | AgentWorkflow |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (>= 2.18) | ✅ (>= 2.18) |\n\n### OpenLLMetry\n\n[OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry) is an open-source project based on OpenTelemetry for tracing and monitoring\nLLM applications. It connects to [all major observability platforms](https://www.traceloop.com/docs/openllmetry/integrations/introduction) and installs in minutes.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\n```python\nfrom traceloop.sdk import Traceloop\nTraceloop.init()\n```\n\n### Langfuse 🪢\n\n[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs) is an open source LLM engineering platform to help teams collaboratively debug, analyze and iterate on their LLM Applications. With the Langfuse integration, you can track and monitor performance, traces, and metrics of your LlamaIndex application. Detailed [traces](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing) of the context augmentation and the LLM querying processes are captured and can be inspected directly in the Langfuse UI.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\nMake sure you have both `llama-index` and `langfuse` installed.\n\n```bash\npip install llama-index langfuse\n```\n\nNext, set up your Langfuse API keys. You can get these keys by signing up for a free [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) account or by [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting). These environment variables are essential for the Langfuse client to authenticate and send data to your Langfuse project.\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\"] = \"your-public-key\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\"] = \"your-secret-key\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_HOST\"] = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\" # or your self-hosted URL\n```\n\nWith the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. `get_client()` initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.\n\n```python\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nlangfuse = Langfuse()\n```\n\nNow, we initialize the [OpenInference LlamaIndex instrumentation](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/llamaindex). This third-party instrumentation automatically captures LlamaIndex operations and exports OpenTelemetry (OTel) spans to Langfuse.\n\n```python\nfrom openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor\nLlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()\n```\n\nYou can now see the logs of your LlamaIndex application in Langfuse.\n\n### Literal AI\n\n[Literal AI](https://literalai.com/) is the go-to LLM evaluation and observability solution, enabling engineering and product teams to ship LLM applications reliably, faster and at scale. This is possible through a collaborative development cycle involving prompt engineering, LLM observability, LLM evaluation and LLM monitoring.

They feature lower costs, higher multilingual performance, and new parameters to control the overall size.\n\n## What are Embeddings?\n\nOpenAI's text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. Embeddings are commonly used for:\n\n- **Search** - where results are ranked by relevance to a query string\n- **Clustering** - where text strings are grouped by similarity\n- **Recommendations** - where items with related text strings are recommended\n- **Anomaly detection** - where outliers with little relatedness are identified\n- **Diversity measurement** - where similarity distributions are analyzed\n- **Classification** - where text strings are classified by their most similar label\n\nAn embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.\n\nVisit the [pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) to learn about embeddings pricing. Requests are billed based on the number of tokens in the input.\n\n## How to Get Embeddings\n\nTo get an embedding, send your text string to the embeddings API endpoint along with the embedding model name (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`):\n\n### Example: Getting Embeddings\n\n**Python:**\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\n    input=\"Your text string goes here\",\n    model=\"text-embedding-3-small\"\n)\n\nprint(response.data[0].embedding)\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n```javascript\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({\n  model: \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n  input: \"Your text string goes here\",\n  encoding_format: \"float\",\n});\n\nconsole.log(embedding);\n```\n\n**cURL:**\n```bash\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"input\": \"Your text string goes here\",\n    \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\"\n  }'\n```\n\n### Response Format\n\nThe response contains the embedding vector (list of floating point numbers) along with some additional metadata:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"object\": \"list\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"object\": \"embedding\",\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"embedding\": [\n        -0.006929283495992422,\n        -0.005336422007530928,\n        -4.547132266452536e-05,\n        -0.024047505110502243\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 5,\n    \"total_tokens\": 5\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy default, the length of the embedding vector is:\n- **1536** for `text-embedding-3-small`\n- **3072** for `text-embedding-3-large`\n\nTo reduce the embedding's dimensions without losing its concept-representing properties, pass in the `dimensions` parameter.\n\n## Embedding Models\n\nOpenAI offers two powerful third-generation embedding models (denoted by `-3` in the model ID).\n\nUsage is priced per input token. Below is an example of pricing pages of text per US dollar (assuming ~800 tokens per page):\n\n| Model | ~ Pages per dollar | Performance on MTEB eval | Max input |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| text-embedding-3-small | 62,500 | 62.3% | 8192 |\n| text-embedding-3-large | 9,615 | 64.6% | 8192 |\n| text-embedding-ada-002 | 12,500 | 61.0% | 8192 |\n\n## Use Cases\n\nHere we show some representative use cases, using the Amazon fine-food reviews dataset.\n\n### Obtaining the Embeddings\n\nThe dataset contains a total of 568,454 food reviews left by Amazon users up to October 2012. We use a subset of the 1000 most recent reviews for illustration purposes.\n\n**Get embeddings from dataset:**\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef get_embedding(text, model=\"text-embedding-3-small\"):\n    text = text.replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n    return client.embeddings.create(input = [text], model=model).data[0].embedding\n\ndf['ada_embedding'] = df.combined.apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, model='text-embedding-3-small'))\ndf.to_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n**Load from saved file:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv')\ndf['ada_embedding'] = df.ada_embedding.apply(eval).apply(np.array)\n```\n\n### Reducing Embedding Dimensions\n\nUsing larger embeddings generally costs more and consumes more compute, memory and storage than using smaller embeddings.\n\nBoth new embedding models were trained with a technique that allows developers to trade-off performance and cost. Specifically, developers can shorten embeddings (i.e. remove some numbers from the end of the sequence) without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties by passing in the `dimensions` API parameter.\n\n**Using dimensions parameter (recommended):**\n```python\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\n    model=\"text-embedding-3-small\",\n    input=\"Testing 123\",\n    dimensions=256\n)\n```\n\n**Manual normalization (when needed):**\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport numpy as np\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef normalize_l2(x):\n    x = np.array(x)\n    if x.ndim == 1:\n        norm = np.linalg.norm(x)\n        if norm == 0:\n            return x\n        return x / norm\n    else:\n        norm = np.linalg.norm(x, 2, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n        return np.where(norm == 0, x, x / norm)\n\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\n    model=\"text-embedding-3-small\",\n    input=\"Testing 123\",\n    encoding_format=\"float\"\n)\n\ncut_dim = response.data[0].embedding[:256]\nnorm_dim = normalize_l2(cut_dim)\n\nprint(norm_dim)\n```\n\n### Text Search Using Embeddings\n\nTo retrieve the most relevant documents, use the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors of the query and each document, and return the highest scored documents.\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport numpy as np\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef cosine_similarity(a, b):\n    return np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))\n\ndef search_reviews(df, product_description, n=3):\n    embedding = client.embeddings.create(\n        input=product_description,\n        model='text-embedding-3-small'\n    ).data[0].embedding\n\n    df['similarities'] = df.ada_embedding.apply(\n        lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, embedding)\n    )\n    res = df.sort_values('similarities', ascending=False).head(n)\n    return res\n\nres = search_reviews(df, 'delicious beans', n=3)\n```\n\n### Code Search Using Embeddings\n\nCode search works similarly to embedding-based text search. We extract functions from Python files and index them using `text-embedding-3-small`.\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef get_embedding(text, model='text-embedding-3-small'):\n    return client.embeddings.create(input=[text], model=model).data[0].embedding\n\ndf['code_embedding'] = df['code'].apply(get_embedding)\n\ndef search_functions(df, code_query, n=3):\n    embedding = get_embedding(code_query, model='text-embedding-3-small')\n    df['similarities'] = df.code_embedding.apply(\n        lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, embedding)\n    )\n    res = df.sort_values('similarities', ascending=False).head(n)\n    return res\n\nres = search_functions(df, 'Completions API tests', n=3)\n```\n\n### Recommendations Using Embeddings\n\nBecause shorter distances between embedding vectors represent greater similarity, embeddings can be useful for recommendation.\n\n```python\ndef recommendations_from_strings(\n    strings: List[str],\n    index_of_source_string: int,\n    model=\"text-embedding-3-small\",\n) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"Return nearest neighbors of a given string.\"\"\"\n\n    # get embeddings for all strings\n    embeddings = [get_embedding(string, model=model) for string in strings]\n\n    # get the embedding of the source string\n    query_embedding = embeddings[index_of_source_string]\n\n    # calculate distances\n    distances = [\n        cosine_similarity(query_embedding, emb)\n        for emb in embeddings\n    ]\n\n    # get indices sorted by similarity\n    indices = np.argsort(distances)[::-1]\n    return indices\n```\n\n### Data Visualization in 2D\n\nThe size of the embeddings varies with the complexity of the underlying model. To visualize this high dimensional data, we use the t-SNE algorithm to transform the data into two dimensions.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv')\nmatrix = df.ada_embedding.apply(eval).to_list()\n\n# Create a t-SNE model and transform the data\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=15, random_state=42,\n            init='random', learning_rate=200)\nvis_dims = tsne.fit_transform(matrix)\n\ncolors = [\"red\", \"darkorange\", \"gold\", \"turquoise\", \"darkgreen\"]\nx = [x for x,y in vis_dims]\ny = [y for x,y in vis_dims]\ncolor_indices = df.Score.values - 1\n\ncolormap = matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap(colors)\nplt.scatter(x, y, c=color_indices, cmap=colormap, alpha=0.3)\nplt.title(\"Amazon ratings visualized in language using t-SNE\")\n```\n\n### Embeddings as Text Feature Encoder for ML\n\nAn embedding can be used as a general free-text feature encoder within a machine learning model.\n\n**Regression example:**\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    list(df.ada_embedding.values),\n    df.Score,\n    test_size=0.2,\n    random_state=42\n)\n\nrfr = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)\nrfr.fit(X_train, y_train)\npreds = rfr.predict(X_test)\n```\n\n**Classification example:**\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\n\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\npreds = clf.predict(X_test)\n```\n\n### Zero-shot Classification\n\nWe can use embeddings for zero-shot classification without any labeled training data. For each class, we embed the class name or a short description. To classify new text, we compare its embedding to all class embeddings and predict the class with the highest similarity.\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport numpy as np\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef cosine_similarity(a, b):\n    return np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))\n\ndef get_embedding(text, model='text-embedding-3-small'):\n    return client.embeddings.create(input=[text], model=model).data[0].embedding\n\n# Prepare labels\nlabels = ['negative', 'positive']\nlabel_embeddings = [get_embedding(label) for label in labels]\n\ndef label_score(review_embedding, label_embeddings):\n    return (cosine_similarity(review_embedding, label_embeddings[1]) -\n            cosine_similarity(review_embedding, label_embeddings[0]))\n\n# Classify\nreview_embedding = get_embedding('Sample Review')\nprediction = 'positive' if label_score(review_embedding, label_embeddings) > 0 else 'negative'\n```\n\n### Clustering\n\nClustering is one way of making sense of a large volume of textual data. Embeddings are useful for this task, as they provide semantically meaningful vector representations of each text.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\nmatrix = np.vstack(df.ada_embedding.values)\nn_clusters = 4\n\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, init='k-means++', random_state=42)\nkmeans.fit(matrix)\ndf['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How can I tell how many tokens a string has before I embed it?\n\nIn Python, you can split a string into tokens with OpenAI's tokenizer `tiktoken`.\n\n```python\nimport tiktoken\n\ndef num_tokens_from_string(string: str, encoding_name: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of tokens in a text string.\"\"\"\n    encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding(encoding_name)\n    num_tokens = len(encoding.encode(string))\n    return num_tokens\n\nnum_tokens_from_string(\"tiktoken is great!\", \"cl100k_base\")\n```\n\nFor third-generation embedding models like `text-embedding-3-small`, use the `cl100k_base` encoding.\n\n### How can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\n\nFor searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database. Examples of working with vector databases and the OpenAI API are available in the OpenAI Cookbook on GitHub.\n\n### Which distance function should I use?\n\nWe recommend **cosine similarity**. The choice of distance function typically doesn't matter much.\n\nOpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\n- Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\n- Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in identical rankings\n\n### Can I share my embeddings online?\n\nYes, customers own their input and output from our models, including embeddings. You are responsible for ensuring that the content you input to our API does not violate any applicable law or our Terms of Use.\n\n### Do V3 embedding models know about recent events?\n\nNo, the `text-embedding-3-large` and `text-embedding-3-small` models lack knowledge of events that occurred after September 2021. This is generally not as much of a limitation as it would be for text generation models but in certain edge cases it can reduce performance.\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":43191,"cache_read_input_tokens":41163,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":43191,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":10051,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTmDfLcZaGkGzBqBfqLzB","type":"assistant","uuid":"c326ef23-2a2e-4921-9ca2-92e251037c74","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:37:18.060Z"}

Take a look below for the full set of guides for each one!\n\n**NOTE:**\n\nObservability is now being handled via the [`instrumentation` module](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability/instrumentation) (available in v0.10.20 and later.)\n\nA lot of the tooling and integrations mentioned in this page use our legacy `CallbackManager` or don't use `set_global_handler`. We've marked these integrations as such!\n\n## Usage Pattern\n\nTo toggle, you will generally just need to do the following:\n\n```python\n# Set global handler\nset_global_handler(handler_name, **kwargs)\n```\n\nNote that all `kwargs` to `set_global_handler` are passed to the underlying callback handler.\n\nAnd that's it! Executions will get seamlessly piped to downstream service and you'll be able to access features such as viewing execution traces of your application.\n\n## Integrations\n\n### OpenTelemetry\n\n[OpenTelemetry](https://openetelemetry.io/) is a widely used open-source service for tracing and observability, with numerous backend integrations (such as Jaeger, Zipkin or Prometheus).\n\nOur OpenTelemetry integration traces all the events produced by pieces of LlamaIndex code, including LLMs, Agents, RAG pipeline components and many more: everything you would get out with LlamaIndex native instrumentation you can export in OpenTelemetry format!\n\nYou can install the library with:\n\n```bash\npip install opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp\n```\n\nAnd can use it in your code with the default settings, as in this example with a RAG pipeline:\n\n```python\nfrom opentelemetry import trace\nfrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider\nfrom opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor\nfrom opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter\n\n# Set up OpenTelemetry\ntrace.set_tracer_provider(TracerProvider())\ntracer_provider = trace.get_tracer_provider()\ntracer_provider.add_span_processor(\n    SimpleSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())\n)\n\n# Your LlamaIndex code here\n```\n\nOr you can use a more complex and customized set-up, such as in the following example:\n\n```python\n# Custom configuration example\n```\n\nWe also have a [demo repository](https://github.com/run-llama/agents-observability-demo) where we show how to trace agentic workflows and pipe the registered traces into a Postgres database.\n\n### LlamaTrace (Hosted Arize Phoenix)\n\nWe've partnered with Arize on [LlamaTrace](https://llamatrace.com/), a hosted tracing, observability, and evaluation platform that works natively with LlamaIndex open-source users and has integrations with LlamaCloud.\n\nThis is built upon the open-source Arize [Phoenix](https://github.com/Arize-ai/phoenix) project. Phoenix provides a notebook-first experience for monitoring your models and LLM Applications by providing:\n\n- LLM Traces - Trace through the execution of your LLM Application to understand the internals of your LLM Application and to troubleshoot problems related to things like retrieval and tool execution.\n- LLM Evals - Leverage the power of large language models to evaluate your generative model or application's relevance, toxicity, and more.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\nTo install the integration package, do `pip install -U llama-index-callbacks-arize-phoenix`.\n\nThen create an account on LlamaTrace: [https://llamatrace.com/login](https://llamatrace.com/login). Create an API key and put it in the `PHOENIX_API_KEY` variable below.\n\nThen run the following code:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"PHOENIX_API_KEY\"] = \"your-api-key\"\n\nimport phoenix as px\npx.launch_app()\n\n# Set up LlamaIndex callback\nfrom llama_index.core import set_global_handler\nset_global_handler(\"arize_phoenix\")\n```\n\n### Weights and Biases (W&B) Weave\n\n[W&B Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/) is a framework for tracking, experimenting with, evaluating, deploying, and improving LLM applications. Designed for scalability and flexibility, Weave supports every stage of your application development workflow.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\nThe integration leverages LlamaIndex's [`instrumentation` module](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability/instrumentation) to register spans/events as Weave calls. By default, Weave automatically patches and tracks calls to [common LLM libraries and frameworks](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/).\n\nInstall the `weave` library:\n\n```bash\npip install weave\n```\n\nGet a W&B API Key:\n\nIf you don't already have a W&B account, create one by visiting [https://wandb.ai](https://wandb.ai/) and copy your API key from [https://wandb.ai/authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize). When prompted to authenticate, enter the API key.\n\n```python\nimport weave\nweave.init('project-name')\n```\n\nTraces include execution time, token usage, cost, inputs/outputs, errors, nested operations, and streaming data. If you are new to Weave tracing, learn more about how to navigate it [here](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/trace-tree).\n\nIf you have a custom function which is not traced, decorate it with [`@weave.op()`](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/guides/tracking/ops).\n\nYou can also control the patching behavior using the `autopatch_settings` argument in `weave.init`. For example if you don't want to trace a library/framework you can turn it off like this:\n\n```python\nweave.init('project-name', autopatch_settings={'llamaindex': False})\n```\n\nNo additional LlamaIndex configuration is required; tracing begins once `weave.init()` is called.\n\n### MLflow\n\n[MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/llms/tracing/index.html) is an open-source MLOps/LLMOps platform, focuses on the full lifecycle for machine learning projects, ensuring that each phase is manageable, traceable, and reproducible.\n**MLflow Tracing** is an OpenTelemetry-based tracing capability and supports one-click instrumentation for LlamaIndex applications.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\nSince MLflow is open-source, you can start using it without any account creation or API key setup. Jump straight into the code after installing the MLflow package!\n\n```python\npip install mlflow\n\nimport mlflow\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog()\n\n# Your LlamaIndex code here\n```\n\n#### Support Table\n\nMLflow Tracing support the full range of LlamaIndex features. Some new features like [AgentWorkflow](https://www.llamaindex.ai/blog/introducing-agentworkflow-a-powerful-system-for-building-ai-agent-systems) requires MLflow >= 2.18.0.\n\n| Streaming | Async | Engine | Agents | Workflow | AgentWorkflow |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (>= 2.18) | ✅ (>= 2.18) |\n\n### OpenLLMetry\n\n[OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry) is an open-source project based on OpenTelemetry for tracing and monitoring\nLLM applications. It connects to [all major observability platforms](https://www.traceloop.com/docs/openllmetry/integrations/introduction) and installs in minutes.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\n```python\nfrom traceloop.sdk import Traceloop\nTraceloop.init()\n```\n\n### Langfuse 🪢\n\n[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/docs) is an open source LLM engineering platform to help teams collaboratively debug, analyze and iterate on their LLM Applications. With the Langfuse integration, you can track and monitor performance, traces, and metrics of your LlamaIndex application. Detailed [traces](https://langfuse.com/docs/tracing) of the context augmentation and the LLM querying processes are captured and can be inspected directly in the Langfuse UI.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\nMake sure you have both `llama-index` and `langfuse` installed.\n\n```bash\npip install llama-index langfuse\n```\n\nNext, set up your Langfuse API keys. You can get these keys by signing up for a free [Langfuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) account or by [self-hosting Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting). These environment variables are essential for the Langfuse client to authenticate and send data to your Langfuse project.\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY\"] = \"your-public-key\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY\"] = \"your-secret-key\"\nos.environ[\"LANGFUSE_HOST\"] = \"https://cloud.langfuse.com\" # or your self-hosted URL\n```\n\nWith the environment variables set, we can now initialize the Langfuse client. `get_client()` initializes the Langfuse client using the credentials provided in the environment variables.\n\n```python\nfrom langfuse import Langfuse\nlangfuse = Langfuse()\n```\n\nNow, we initialize the [OpenInference LlamaIndex instrumentation](https://docs.arize.com/phoenix/tracing/integrations-tracing/llamaindex). This third-party instrumentation automatically captures LlamaIndex operations and exports OpenTelemetry (OTel) spans to Langfuse.\n\n```python\nfrom openinference.instrumentation.llama_index import LlamaIndexInstrumentor\nLlamaIndexInstrumentor().instrument()\n```\n\nYou can now see the logs of your LlamaIndex application in Langfuse.\n\n### Literal AI\n\n[Literal AI](https://literalai.com/) is the go-to LLM evaluation and observability solution, enabling engineering and product teams to ship LLM applications reliably, faster and at scale. This is possible through a collaborative development cycle involving prompt engineering, LLM observability, LLM evaluation and LLM monitoring. Conversation Threads and Agent Runs can be automatically logged on Literal AI.\n\nThe simplest way to get started and try out Literal AI is to signup on our [cloud instance](https://cloud.getliteral.ai/).\nYou can then navigate to **Settings**, grab your API key, and start logging!\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\n- Install the Literal AI Python SDK with `pip install literalai`\n- On your Literal AI project, go to **Settings** and grab your API key\n- If you are using a self-hosted instance of Literal AI, also make note of its base URL\n\nThen add the following lines to your applicative code :\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"LITERAL_API_KEY\"] = \"your-api-key\"\n\nfrom llama_index.core import set_global_handler\nset_global_handler(\"literalai\")\n```\n\n### Comet Opik\n\n[Opik](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/?utm_source=llama-index&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=opik&utm_content=home_page) is an open-source end to end LLM Evaluation Platform built by Comet.\n\nTo get started, simply sign up for an account on [Comet](https://www.comet.com/signup?from=llm&utm_medium=github&utm_source=llama-index&utm_campaign=opik) and grab your API key.\n\n#### Usage Pattern\n\n- Install the Opik Python SDK with `pip install opik`\n- In Opik, get your API key from the user menu.\n- If you are using a self-hosted instance of Opik, also make note of its base URL.\n\nYou can configure Opik using the environment variables `OPIK_API_KEY`, `OPIK_WORKSPACE` and `OPIK_URL_OVERRIDE` if you are using a [self-hosted instance](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/self-host/self_hosting_opik). You can set these by calling:\n\n```python\nimport os\nos.environ[\"OPIK_API_KEY\"] = \"your-api-key\"\nos.environ[\"OPIK_WORKSPACE\"] = \"your-workspace\"\n```\n\nYou can now use the Opik integration with LlamaIndex by setting the global handler:\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core import set_global_handler\nset_global_handler(\"opik\")\n```\n\n### Additional Integrations\n\nThe guide also covers many other observability integrations including:\n\n- **Argilla** - Collaboration tool for AI engineers\n- **Agenta** - Open-source LLMOps platform\n- **Deepeval** - Evaluation framework for LLM applications\n- **Maxim AI** - Agent Simulation and Evaluation platform\n- **HoneyHive** - Trace execution flow and debugging\n- **PromptLayer** - Analytics and prompt management\n- **Langtrace** - OpenTelemetry-based tracing\n- **OpenLIT** - OpenTelemetry-native GenAI observability\n- **AgentOps** - Agent monitoring and evaluation\n\nAnd legacy integrations using the `CallbackManager`:\n- **TruEra TruLens** - Evaluation and feedback functions\n- **OpenInference** - Open standard for AI model inferences\n- **Simple (LLM Inputs/Outputs)** - Basic console logging\n\nFor detailed usage patterns and examples for each integration, refer to the official LlamaIndex documentation.\n\n## More observability\n\n- [Callbacks Guide](https://developers.llamaindex.ai/python/framework/module_guides/observability/callbacks)\n","structuredPatch":[]}}

They feature lower costs, higher multilingual performance, and new parameters to control the overall size.\n\n## What are Embeddings?\n\nOpenAI's text embeddings measure the relatedness of text strings. Embeddings are commonly used for:\n\n- **Search** - where results are ranked by relevance to a query string\n- **Clustering** - where text strings are grouped by similarity\n- **Recommendations** - where items with related text strings are recommended\n- **Anomaly detection** - where outliers with little relatedness are identified\n- **Diversity measurement** - where similarity distributions are analyzed\n- **Classification** - where text strings are classified by their most similar label\n\nAn embedding is a vector (list) of floating point numbers. The distance between two vectors measures their relatedness. Small distances suggest high relatedness and large distances suggest low relatedness.\n\nVisit the [pricing page](https://openai.com/api/pricing/) to learn about embeddings pricing. Requests are billed based on the number of tokens in the input.\n\n## How to Get Embeddings\n\nTo get an embedding, send your text string to the embeddings API endpoint along with the embedding model name (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`):\n\n### Example: Getting Embeddings\n\n**Python:**\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\n    input=\"Your text string goes here\",\n    model=\"text-embedding-3-small\"\n)\n\nprint(response.data[0].embedding)\n```\n\n**JavaScript:**\n```javascript\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({\n  model: \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n  input: \"Your text string goes here\",\n  encoding_format: \"float\",\n});\n\nconsole.log(embedding);\n```\n\n**cURL:**\n```bash\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"input\": \"Your text string goes here\",\n    \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\"\n  }'\n```\n\n### Response Format\n\nThe response contains the embedding vector (list of floating point numbers) along with some additional metadata:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"object\": \"list\",\n  \"data\": [\n    {\n      \"object\": \"embedding\",\n      \"index\": 0,\n      \"embedding\": [\n        -0.006929283495992422,\n        -0.005336422007530928,\n        -4.547132266452536e-05,\n        -0.024047505110502243\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"model\": \"text-embedding-3-small\",\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 5,\n    \"total_tokens\": 5\n  }\n}\n```\n\nBy default, the length of the embedding vector is:\n- **1536** for `text-embedding-3-small`\n- **3072** for `text-embedding-3-large`\n\nTo reduce the embedding's dimensions without losing its concept-representing properties, pass in the `dimensions` parameter.\n\n## Embedding Models\n\nOpenAI offers two powerful third-generation embedding models (denoted by `-3` in the model ID).\n\nUsage is priced per input token. Below is an example of pricing pages of text per US dollar (assuming ~800 tokens per page):\n\n| Model | ~ Pages per dollar | Performance on MTEB eval | Max input |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| text-embedding-3-small | 62,500 | 62.3% | 8192 |\n| text-embedding-3-large | 9,615 | 64.6% | 8192 |\n| text-embedding-ada-002 | 12,500 | 61.0% | 8192 |\n\n## Use Cases\n\nHere we show some representative use cases, using the Amazon fine-food reviews dataset.\n\n### Obtaining the Embeddings\n\nThe dataset contains a total of 568,454 food reviews left by Amazon users up to October 2012. We use a subset of the 1000 most recent reviews for illustration purposes.\n\n**Get embeddings from dataset:**\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef get_embedding(text, model=\"text-embedding-3-small\"):\n    text = text.replace(\"\\n\", \" \")\n    return client.embeddings.create(input = [text], model=model).data[0].embedding\n\ndf['ada_embedding'] = df.combined.apply(lambda x: get_embedding(x, model='text-embedding-3-small'))\ndf.to_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv', index=False)\n```\n\n**Load from saved file:**\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv')\ndf['ada_embedding'] = df.ada_embedding.apply(eval).apply(np.array)\n```\n\n### Reducing Embedding Dimensions\n\nUsing larger embeddings generally costs more and consumes more compute, memory and storage than using smaller embeddings.\n\nBoth new embedding models were trained with a technique that allows developers to trade-off performance and cost. Specifically, developers can shorten embeddings (i.e. remove some numbers from the end of the sequence) without the embedding losing its concept-representing properties by passing in the `dimensions` API parameter.\n\n**Using dimensions parameter (recommended):**\n```python\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\n    model=\"text-embedding-3-small\",\n    input=\"Testing 123\",\n    dimensions=256\n)\n```\n\n**Manual normalization (when needed):**\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport numpy as np\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef normalize_l2(x):\n    x = np.array(x)\n    if x.ndim == 1:\n        norm = np.linalg.norm(x)\n        if norm == 0:\n            return x\n        return x / norm\n    else:\n        norm = np.linalg.norm(x, 2, axis=1, keepdims=True)\n        return np.where(norm == 0, x, x / norm)\n\nresponse = client.embeddings.create(\n    model=\"text-embedding-3-small\",\n    input=\"Testing 123\",\n    encoding_format=\"float\"\n)\n\ncut_dim = response.data[0].embedding[:256]\nnorm_dim = normalize_l2(cut_dim)\n\nprint(norm_dim)\n```\n\n### Text Search Using Embeddings\n\nTo retrieve the most relevant documents, use the cosine similarity between the embedding vectors of the query and each document, and return the highest scored documents.\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport numpy as np\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef cosine_similarity(a, b):\n    return np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))\n\ndef search_reviews(df, product_description, n=3):\n    embedding = client.embeddings.create(\n        input=product_description,\n        model='text-embedding-3-small'\n    ).data[0].embedding\n\n    df['similarities'] = df.ada_embedding.apply(\n        lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, embedding)\n    )\n    res = df.sort_values('similarities', ascending=False).head(n)\n    return res\n\nres = search_reviews(df, 'delicious beans', n=3)\n```\n\n### Code Search Using Embeddings\n\nCode search works similarly to embedding-based text search. We extract functions from Python files and index them using `text-embedding-3-small`.\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef get_embedding(text, model='text-embedding-3-small'):\n    return client.embeddings.create(input=[text], model=model).data[0].embedding\n\ndf['code_embedding'] = df['code'].apply(get_embedding)\n\ndef search_functions(df, code_query, n=3):\n    embedding = get_embedding(code_query, model='text-embedding-3-small')\n    df['similarities'] = df.code_embedding.apply(\n        lambda x: cosine_similarity(x, embedding)\n    )\n    res = df.sort_values('similarities', ascending=False).head(n)\n    return res\n\nres = search_functions(df, 'Completions API tests', n=3)\n```\n\n### Recommendations Using Embeddings\n\nBecause shorter distances between embedding vectors represent greater similarity, embeddings can be useful for recommendation.\n\n```python\ndef recommendations_from_strings(\n    strings: List[str],\n    index_of_source_string: int,\n    model=\"text-embedding-3-small\",\n) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"Return nearest neighbors of a given string.\"\"\"\n\n    # get embeddings for all strings\n    embeddings = [get_embedding(string, model=model) for string in strings]\n\n    # get the embedding of the source string\n    query_embedding = embeddings[index_of_source_string]\n\n    # calculate distances\n    distances = [\n        cosine_similarity(query_embedding, emb)\n        for emb in embeddings\n    ]\n\n    # get indices sorted by similarity\n    indices = np.argsort(distances)[::-1]\n    return indices\n```\n\n### Data Visualization in 2D\n\nThe size of the embeddings varies with the complexity of the underlying model. To visualize this high dimensional data, we use the t-SNE algorithm to transform the data into two dimensions.\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.manifold import TSNE\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('output/embedded_1k_reviews.csv')\nmatrix = df.ada_embedding.apply(eval).to_list()\n\n# Create a t-SNE model and transform the data\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, perplexity=15, random_state=42,\n            init='random', learning_rate=200)\nvis_dims = tsne.fit_transform(matrix)\n\ncolors = [\"red\", \"darkorange\", \"gold\", \"turquoise\", \"darkgreen\"]\nx = [x for x,y in vis_dims]\ny = [y for x,y in vis_dims]\ncolor_indices = df.Score.values - 1\n\ncolormap = matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap(colors)\nplt.scatter(x, y, c=color_indices, cmap=colormap, alpha=0.3)\nplt.title(\"Amazon ratings visualized in language using t-SNE\")\n```\n\n### Embeddings as Text Feature Encoder for ML\n\nAn embedding can be used as a general free-text feature encoder within a machine learning model.\n\n**Regression example:**\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    list(df.ada_embedding.values),\n    df.Score,\n    test_size=0.2,\n    random_state=42\n)\n\nrfr = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100)\nrfr.fit(X_train, y_train)\npreds = rfr.predict(X_test)\n```\n\n**Classification example:**\n```python\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report, accuracy_score\n\nclf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)\nclf.fit(X_train, y_train)\npreds = clf.predict(X_test)\n```\n\n### Zero-shot Classification\n\nWe can use embeddings for zero-shot classification without any labeled training data. For each class, we embed the class name or a short description. To classify new text, we compare its embedding to all class embeddings and predict the class with the highest similarity.\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport numpy as np\n\nclient = OpenAI()\n\ndef cosine_similarity(a, b):\n    return np.dot(a, b) / (np.linalg.norm(a) * np.linalg.norm(b))\n\ndef get_embedding(text, model='text-embedding-3-small'):\n    return client.embeddings.create(input=[text], model=model).data[0].embedding\n\n# Prepare labels\nlabels = ['negative', 'positive']\nlabel_embeddings = [get_embedding(label) for label in labels]\n\ndef label_score(review_embedding, label_embeddings):\n    return (cosine_similarity(review_embedding, label_embeddings[1]) -\n            cosine_similarity(review_embedding, label_embeddings[0]))\n\n# Classify\nreview_embedding = get_embedding('Sample Review')\nprediction = 'positive' if label_score(review_embedding, label_embeddings) > 0 else 'negative'\n```\n\n### Clustering\n\nClustering is one way of making sense of a large volume of textual data. Embeddings are useful for this task, as they provide semantically meaningful vector representations of each text.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\n\nmatrix = np.vstack(df.ada_embedding.values)\nn_clusters = 4\n\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, init='k-means++', random_state=42)\nkmeans.fit(matrix)\ndf['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_\n```\n\n## FAQ\n\n### How can I tell how many tokens a string has before I embed it?\n\nIn Python, you can split a string into tokens with OpenAI's tokenizer `tiktoken`.\n\n```python\nimport tiktoken\n\ndef num_tokens_from_string(string: str, encoding_name: str) -> int:\n    \"\"\"Returns the number of tokens in a text string.\"\"\"\n    encoding = tiktoken.get_encoding(encoding_name)\n    num_tokens = len(encoding.encode(string))\n    return num_tokens\n\nnum_tokens_from_string(\"tiktoken is great!\", \"cl100k_base\")\n```\n\nFor third-generation embedding models like `text-embedding-3-small`, use the `cl100k_base` encoding.\n\n### How can I retrieve K nearest embedding vectors quickly?\n\nFor searching over many vectors quickly, we recommend using a vector database. Examples of working with vector databases and the OpenAI API are available in the OpenAI Cookbook on GitHub.\n\n### Which distance function should I use?\n\nWe recommend **cosine similarity**. The choice of distance function typically doesn't matter much.\n\nOpenAI embeddings are normalized to length 1, which means that:\n- Cosine similarity can be computed slightly faster using just a dot product\n- Cosine similarity and Euclidean distance will result in identical rankings\n\n### Can I share my embeddings online?\n\nYes, customers own their input and output from our models, including embeddings. You are responsible for ensuring that the content you input to our API does not violate any applicable law or our Terms of Use.\n\n### Do V3 embedding models know about recent events?\n\nNo, the `text-embedding-3-large` and `text-embedding-3-small` models lack knowledge of events that occurred after September 2021. This is generally not as much of a limitation as it would be for text generation models but in certain edge cases it can reduce performance.\n","structuredPatch":[]}}

\\\"Direct link to Production Readiness\\\")\\n\\nMLflow Tracing is production ready and provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for your GenAI applications in production environments. By enabling [async logging](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/prod-tracing/#asynchronous-trace-logging), trace logging is done in the background and does not impact the performance of your application.\\n\\nFor production deployments, it is recommended to use the [Lightweight Tracing SDK](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/lightweight-sdk/) ( `mlflow-tracing`) that is optimized for reducing the total installation size and minimizing dependencies while maintaining full tracing capabilities. Compared to the full `mlflow` package, the `mlflow-tracing` package requires 95% smaller footprint.\\n\\nRead [Production Monitoring](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/prod-tracing/) for complete guidance on using MLflow Tracing for monitoring models in production and various backend configuration options.\\n\\n- [Use Cases Throughout the ML Lifecycle](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/#use-cases-throughout-the-ml-lifecycle)\\n- [What Makes MLflow Tracing Unique?](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/#what-makes-mlflow-tracing-unique)\\n- [Getting Started](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/#getting-started)\\n- [One-line Auto Tracing Integrations](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/#one-line-auto-tracing-integrations)\\n- [Flexible and Customizable](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/#flexible-and-customizable)\\n- [Production Readiness](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/#production-readiness)\\n\\n![brand logo](https://mlflow.org/img/mlflow-favicon.ico)Ask AI\",\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"docusaurus_version\": \"current\",\n        \"title\": \"MLflow Tracing for LLM Observability | MLflow\",\n        \"description\": \"MLflow Tracing enhances LLM observability in your applications by capturing the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.\",\n        \"docusaurus_locale\": \"en\",\n        \"og:title\": \"MLflow Tracing for LLM Observability | MLflow\",\n        \"favicon\": \"https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/images/favicon.ico\",\n        \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\",\n        \"docsearch:version\": \"current\",\n        \"docsearch:docusaurus_tag\": \"docs-genai-current\",\n        \"ogTitle\": \"MLflow Tracing for LLM Observability | MLflow\",\n        \"docusaurus_tag\": \"docs-genai-current\",\n        \"docsearch:language\": \"en\",\n        \"og:locale\": \"en\",\n        \"og:description\": \"MLflow Tracing enhances LLM observability in your applications by capturing the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.\",\n        \"og:url\": \"https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/\",\n        \"ogLocale\": \"en\",\n        \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n        \"ogDescription\": \"MLflow Tracing enhances LLM observability in your applications by capturing the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.\",\n        \"language\": \"en\",\n        \"ogUrl\": \"https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/\",\n        \"generator\": \"Docusaurus v3.8.1\",\n        \"scrapeId\": \"5159cd55-12f7-4482-9a93-4920af58933e\",\n        \"sourceURL\": \"https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/\",\n        \"url\": \"https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/\",\n        \"statusCode\": 200,\n        \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n        \"proxyUsed\": \"basic\",\n        \"cacheState\": \"miss\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}]}

You can enable tracing for LlamaIndex by calling the `mlflow.llama_index.autolog()` function, and nested traces are automatically logged to the active MLflow Experiment upon invocation of LlamaIndex engines and workflows.\n\n![LlamaIndex Tracing via autolog](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/assets/images/llamaindex-tracing-67ed751e565ef74209381a497c70cf18.gif)\n\n## Overview\n\n[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is an open-source framework for building agentic generative AI applications that allow large language models to work with your data in any format.\n\nMLflow Tracing is an OpenTelemetry-based tracing capability and supports one-click instrumentation for LlamaIndex applications.\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\n\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog()\n```\n\n**Note**: MLflow LlamaIndex integration is not only about tracing. MLflow offers full tracking experience for LlamaIndex, including model tracking, index management, and evaluation. Check out the [MLflow LlamaIndex Flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/flavors/llama-index/) to learn more!\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Setup Test Data\n\nFirst, let's download test data to create a toy index:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p data\ncurl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt -o ./data/paul_graham_essay.txt\n```\n\n### Create Vector Index\n\nLoad documents into a simple in-memory vector index:\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\n\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"data\").load_data()\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\n```\n\n### Enable Tracing and Query\n\nNow you can enable LlamaIndex auto tracing and start querying the index:\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\n\n# Enabling tracing for LlamaIndex\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog()\n\n# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://localhost:5000\")\nmlflow.set_experiment(\"LlamaIndex\")\n\n# Query the index\nquery_engine = index.as_query_engine()\nresponse = query_engine.query(\"What was the first program the author wrote?\")\n```\n\n## Token Usage Tracking\n\nMLflow >= 3.2.0 supports token usage tracking for LlamaIndex. The token usage for each LLM call will be logged in the `mlflow.chat.tokenUsage` attribute. The total token usage throughout the trace will be available in the `token_usage` field of the trace info object.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport mlflow\nfrom llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI\nfrom llama_index.core import Settings\nfrom llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage\n\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog()\n\n# Use the chat complete method to create new chat\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\nSettings.llm = llm\nresponse = llm.chat(\n    [ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=\"What is the capital of France?\")]\n)\n\n# Get the trace object just created\nlast_trace_id = mlflow.get_last_active_trace_id()\ntrace = mlflow.get_trace(trace_id=last_trace_id)\n\n# Print the token usage\ntotal_usage = trace.info.token_usage\nprint(\"== Total token usage: ==\")\nprint(f\"  Input tokens: {total_usage['input_tokens']}\")\nprint(f\"  Output tokens: {total_usage['output_tokens']}\")\nprint(f\"  Total tokens: {total_usage['total_tokens']}\")\n\n# Print the token usage for each LLM call\nprint(\"\\n== Detailed usage for each LLM call: ==\")\nfor span in trace.data.spans:\n    if usage := span.get_attribute(\"mlflow.chat.tokenUsage\"):\n        print(f\"{span.name}:\")\n        print(f\"  Input tokens: {usage['input_tokens']}\")\n        print(f\"  Output tokens: {usage['output_tokens']}\")\n        print(f\"  Total tokens: {usage['total_tokens']}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n== Total token usage: ==\n  Input tokens: 14\n  Output tokens: 7\n  Total tokens: 21\n\n== Detailed usage for each LLM call: ==\nOpenAI.chat:\n  Input tokens: 14\n  Output tokens: 7\n  Total tokens: 21\n```\n\n## LlamaIndex Workflow\n\nThe `Workflow` is LlamaIndex's next-generation GenAI orchestration framework. It is designed as a flexible and interpretable framework for building arbitrary LLM applications such as an agent, a RAG flow, a data extraction pipeline, etc.\n\nMLflow supports tracking, evaluating, and tracing the Workflow objects, which makes them more observable and maintainable.\n\nAutomatic tracing for LlamaIndex workflow works off-the-shelf by calling the same `mlflow.llama_index.autolog()`.\n\nTo learn more about MLflow's integration with LlamaIndex Workflow, continue to the following tutorials:\n- [Building Advanced RAG with MLflow and LlamaIndex Workflow](https://mlflow.org/blog/mlflow-llama-index-workflow)\n\n## Disable Auto-Tracing\n\nAuto tracing for LlamaIndex can be disabled globally by calling:\n\n```python\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog(disable=True)\n# or\nmlflow.autolog(disable=True)\n```\n\n## MLflow Tracing Overview\n\nMLflow Tracing enhances LLM observability in your applications by capturing the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.\n\n### Use Cases Throughout the ML Lifecycle\n\nMLflow Tracing empowers you throughout the end-to-end lifecycle of a machine learning project:\n\n#### Build & Debug\nTraces provide deep insights into what happens beneath the abstractions of GenAI libraries, helping you precisely identify where issues occur. You can navigate traces seamlessly within your preferred IDE, notebook, or the MLflow UI.\n\n#### Track Annotation and Human Feedbacks\nHuman feedback is essential for building high-quality GenAI applications. MLflow supports collecting, managing, and utilizing feedback from end-users and domain experts. Feedbacks are attached to traces and recorded with metadata, including user, timestamp, revisions, etc.\n\n#### Evaluate and Enhance Quality\nCombined with MLflow GenAI Evaluation, MLflow offers a seamless experience for evaluating your applications. Tracing helps by allowing you to track quality assessment and inspect the evaluation results with visibility into the internals of the system.\n\n#### Monitor Applications in Production\nMLflow Tracing captures key metrics like latency and token usage at each step, as well as various quality metrics, helping you identify bottlenecks, monitor efficiency, and find optimization opportunities.\n\n#### Create High-Quality Datasets\nTraces from production systems capture perfect data for building high-quality datasets with precise details for internal components like retrievers and tools.\n\n## What Makes MLflow Tracing Unique?\n\n### Open Source\nMLflow is open source and 100% FREE. You don't need to pay additional SaaS costs to add observability to your GenAI stack. Your trace data is hosted on your own infrastructure.\n\n### OpenTelemetry\nMLflow Tracing is compatible with OpenTelemetry, making it free from vendor lock-in and easy to integrate with your existing observability stack.\n\n### Framework Agnostic\nMLflow Tracing integrates with 20+ GenAI libraries, including OpenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, Pydantic AI, allowing you to switch between frameworks with ease.\n\n### End-to-End Platform\nMLflow Tracing empowers you throughout the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, combined with its version tracking and evaluation capabilities.\n\n### Strong Community\nMLflow boasts a vibrant Open Source community as a part of the Linux Foundation, with 20K+ GitHub Stars and 20MM+ monthly downloads.\n\n## One-line Auto Tracing Integrations\n\nMLflow Tracing is integrated with various GenAI libraries and provides one-line automatic tracing experience for each library:\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\n\nmlflow.openai.autolog()  # or replace 'openai' with other library names\n```\n\nSupported integrations include:\n- OpenAI\n- LangChain\n- LangGraph\n- LlamaIndex\n- Anthropic\n- DSPy\n- Bedrock\n- Semantic Kernel\n- AutoGen\n- AG2\n- Gemini\n- LiteLLM\n- CrewAI\n- Ollama\n- PydanticAI\n- And many more...\n\n## Flexible and Customizable\n\nIn addition to one-line auto tracing, MLflow offers Python SDK for manually instrumenting your code:\n\n- Trace a function with `@mlflow.trace` decorator\n- Trace any block of code using context manager\n- Combine multiple auto-tracing integrations\n- Instrument multi-threaded applications\n- Native async support\n- Group and filter traces using sessions\n- Redact PII data from traces\n- Disable tracing globally\n- Configure sampling ratio to control trace throughput\n\n## Production Readiness\n\nMLflow Tracing is production ready and provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for your GenAI applications. By enabling async logging, trace logging is done in the background and does not impact application performance.\n\nFor production deployments, it is recommended to use the **Lightweight Tracing SDK** (`mlflow-tracing`) that is optimized for reducing the total installation size and minimizing dependencies while maintaining full tracing capabilities. Compared to the full `mlflow` package, the `mlflow-tracing` package requires 95% smaller footprint.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [MLflow Tracing Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/)\n- [MLflow LlamaIndex Flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/flavors/llama-index/)\n- [Production Monitoring Guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/prod-tracing/)\n- [Building Advanced RAG with MLflow and LlamaIndex Workflow](https://mlflow.org/blog/mlflow-llama-index-workflow)\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":18742,"cache_read_input_tokens":94654,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":18742,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":8539,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTmDxEJH1vF4FHm1qMtVd","type":"assistant","uuid":"2cd721d6-8dee-4ed8-8b11-07732e002803","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:38:52.509Z"}

vector_store_query_mode=\"hybrid\",\n    alpha=0.5  # Balance between dense and sparse\n)\n```\n\n### Qdrant Hybrid Search\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.vector_stores.qdrant import QdrantVectorStore\n\nvector_store = QdrantVectorStore(\n    client=client,\n    collection_name=\"hybrid_collection\",\n    enable_hybrid=True\n)\n\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(vector_store)\nquery_engine = index.as_query_engine(\n    vector_store_query_mode=\"hybrid\"\n)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Choose the Right Vector Store**:\n   - For prototyping: Chroma, FAISS (local)\n   - For production: Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate (managed)\n   - For existing infrastructure: PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis\n\n2. **Dimension Considerations**:\n   - Match vector dimensions to your embedding model\n   - Common dimensions: 384, 768, 1536, 3072\n\n3. **Indexing Strategy**:\n   - Use HNSW for fast approximate search\n   - Consider IVF for very large datasets\n   - Flat index for small datasets or exact search\n\n4. **Performance Optimization**:\n   - Batch document insertions\n   - Use async operations when available\n   - Configure appropriate index parameters\n\n5. **Metadata Filtering**:\n   - Store relevant metadata with vectors\n   - Use filters to narrow search space\n   - Combine with hybrid search for best results\n\n## Complete Example Notebooks\n\nLlamaIndex provides extensive example notebooks for each vector store integration:\n\n- [Pinecone

You can enable tracing for LlamaIndex by calling the `mlflow.llama_index.autolog()` function, and nested traces are automatically logged to the active MLflow Experiment upon invocation of LlamaIndex engines and workflows.\n\n![LlamaIndex Tracing via autolog](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/assets/images/llamaindex-tracing-67ed751e565ef74209381a497c70cf18.gif)\n\n## Overview\n\n[LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) is an open-source framework for building agentic generative AI applications that allow large language models to work with your data in any format.\n\nMLflow Tracing is an OpenTelemetry-based tracing capability and supports one-click instrumentation for LlamaIndex applications.\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\n\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog()\n```\n\n**Note**: MLflow LlamaIndex integration is not only about tracing. MLflow offers full tracking experience for LlamaIndex, including model tracking, index management, and evaluation. Check out the [MLflow LlamaIndex Flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/flavors/llama-index/) to learn more!\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Setup Test Data\n\nFirst, let's download test data to create a toy index:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p data\ncurl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/run-llama/llama_index/main/docs/docs/examples/data/paul_graham/paul_graham_essay.txt -o ./data/paul_graham_essay.txt\n```\n\n### Create Vector Index\n\nLoad documents into a simple in-memory vector index:\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\n\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"data\").load_data()\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)\n```\n\n### Enable Tracing and Query\n\nNow you can enable LlamaIndex auto tracing and start querying the index:\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\n\n# Enabling tracing for LlamaIndex\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog()\n\n# Optional: Set a tracking URI and an experiment\nmlflow.set_tracking_uri(\"http://localhost:5000\")\nmlflow.set_experiment(\"LlamaIndex\")\n\n# Query the index\nquery_engine = index.as_query_engine()\nresponse = query_engine.query(\"What was the first program the author wrote?\")\n```\n\n## Token Usage Tracking\n\nMLflow >= 3.2.0 supports token usage tracking for LlamaIndex. The token usage for each LLM call will be logged in the `mlflow.chat.tokenUsage` attribute. The total token usage throughout the trace will be available in the `token_usage` field of the trace info object.\n\n```python\nimport json\nimport mlflow\nfrom llama_index.llms.openai import OpenAI\nfrom llama_index.core import Settings\nfrom llama_index.core.llms import ChatMessage\n\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog()\n\n# Use the chat complete method to create new chat\nllm = OpenAI(model=\"gpt-3.5-turbo\")\nSettings.llm = llm\nresponse = llm.chat(\n    [ChatMessage(role=\"user\", content=\"What is the capital of France?\")]\n)\n\n# Get the trace object just created\nlast_trace_id = mlflow.get_last_active_trace_id()\ntrace = mlflow.get_trace(trace_id=last_trace_id)\n\n# Print the token usage\ntotal_usage = trace.info.token_usage\nprint(\"== Total token usage: ==\")\nprint(f\"  Input tokens: {total_usage['input_tokens']}\")\nprint(f\"  Output tokens: {total_usage['output_tokens']}\")\nprint(f\"  Total tokens: {total_usage['total_tokens']}\")\n\n# Print the token usage for each LLM call\nprint(\"\\n== Detailed usage for each LLM call: ==\")\nfor span in trace.data.spans:\n    if usage := span.get_attribute(\"mlflow.chat.tokenUsage\"):\n        print(f\"{span.name}:\")\n        print(f\"  Input tokens: {usage['input_tokens']}\")\n        print(f\"  Output tokens: {usage['output_tokens']}\")\n        print(f\"  Total tokens: {usage['total_tokens']}\")\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\n== Total token usage: ==\n  Input tokens: 14\n  Output tokens: 7\n  Total tokens: 21\n\n== Detailed usage for each LLM call: ==\nOpenAI.chat:\n  Input tokens: 14\n  Output tokens: 7\n  Total tokens: 21\n```\n\n## LlamaIndex Workflow\n\nThe `Workflow` is LlamaIndex's next-generation GenAI orchestration framework. It is designed as a flexible and interpretable framework for building arbitrary LLM applications such as an agent, a RAG flow, a data extraction pipeline, etc.\n\nMLflow supports tracking, evaluating, and tracing the Workflow objects, which makes them more observable and maintainable.\n\nAutomatic tracing for LlamaIndex workflow works off-the-shelf by calling the same `mlflow.llama_index.autolog()`.\n\nTo learn more about MLflow's integration with LlamaIndex Workflow, continue to the following tutorials:\n- [Building Advanced RAG with MLflow and LlamaIndex Workflow](https://mlflow.org/blog/mlflow-llama-index-workflow)\n\n## Disable Auto-Tracing\n\nAuto tracing for LlamaIndex can be disabled globally by calling:\n\n```python\nmlflow.llama_index.autolog(disable=True)\n# or\nmlflow.autolog(disable=True)\n```\n\n## MLflow Tracing Overview\n\nMLflow Tracing enhances LLM observability in your applications by capturing the inputs, outputs, and metadata associated with each intermediate step of a request, enabling you to easily pinpoint the source of bugs and unexpected behaviors.\n\n### Use Cases Throughout the ML Lifecycle\n\nMLflow Tracing empowers you throughout the end-to-end lifecycle of a machine learning project:\n\n#### Build & Debug\nTraces provide deep insights into what happens beneath the abstractions of GenAI libraries, helping you precisely identify where issues occur. You can navigate traces seamlessly within your preferred IDE, notebook, or the MLflow UI.\n\n#### Track Annotation and Human Feedbacks\nHuman feedback is essential for building high-quality GenAI applications. MLflow supports collecting, managing, and utilizing feedback from end-users and domain experts. Feedbacks are attached to traces and recorded with metadata, including user, timestamp, revisions, etc.\n\n#### Evaluate and Enhance Quality\nCombined with MLflow GenAI Evaluation, MLflow offers a seamless experience for evaluating your applications. Tracing helps by allowing you to track quality assessment and inspect the evaluation results with visibility into the internals of the system.\n\n#### Monitor Applications in Production\nMLflow Tracing captures key metrics like latency and token usage at each step, as well as various quality metrics, helping you identify bottlenecks, monitor efficiency, and find optimization opportunities.\n\n#### Create High-Quality Datasets\nTraces from production systems capture perfect data for building high-quality datasets with precise details for internal components like retrievers and tools.\n\n## What Makes MLflow Tracing Unique?\n\n### Open Source\nMLflow is open source and 100% FREE. You don't need to pay additional SaaS costs to add observability to your GenAI stack. Your trace data is hosted on your own infrastructure.\n\n### OpenTelemetry\nMLflow Tracing is compatible with OpenTelemetry, making it free from vendor lock-in and easy to integrate with your existing observability stack.\n\n### Framework Agnostic\nMLflow Tracing integrates with 20+ GenAI libraries, including OpenAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, DSPy, Pydantic AI, allowing you to switch between frameworks with ease.\n\n### End-to-End Platform\nMLflow Tracing empowers you throughout the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, combined with its version tracking and evaluation capabilities.\n\n### Strong Community\nMLflow boasts a vibrant Open Source community as a part of the Linux Foundation, with 20K+ GitHub Stars and 20MM+ monthly downloads.\n\n## One-line Auto Tracing Integrations\n\nMLflow Tracing is integrated with various GenAI libraries and provides one-line automatic tracing experience for each library:\n\n```python\nimport mlflow\n\nmlflow.openai.autolog()  # or replace 'openai' with other library names\n```\n\nSupported integrations include:\n- OpenAI\n- LangChain\n- LangGraph\n- LlamaIndex\n- Anthropic\n- DSPy\n- Bedrock\n- Semantic Kernel\n- AutoGen\n- AG2\n- Gemini\n- LiteLLM\n- CrewAI\n- Ollama\n- PydanticAI\n- And many more...\n\n## Flexible and Customizable\n\nIn addition to one-line auto tracing, MLflow offers Python SDK for manually instrumenting your code:\n\n- Trace a function with `@mlflow.trace` decorator\n- Trace any block of code using context manager\n- Combine multiple auto-tracing integrations\n- Instrument multi-threaded applications\n- Native async support\n- Group and filter traces using sessions\n- Redact PII data from traces\n- Disable tracing globally\n- Configure sampling ratio to control trace throughput\n\n## Production Readiness\n\nMLflow Tracing is production ready and provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for your GenAI applications. By enabling async logging, trace logging is done in the background and does not impact application performance.\n\nFor production deployments, it is recommended to use the **Lightweight Tracing SDK** (`mlflow-tracing`) that is optimized for reducing the total installation size and minimizing dependencies while maintaining full tracing capabilities. Compared to the full `mlflow` package, the `mlflow-tracing` package requires 95% smaller footprint.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- [MLflow Tracing Documentation](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/)\n- [MLflow LlamaIndex Flavor](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/flavors/llama-index/)\n- [Production Monitoring Guide](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/genai/tracing/prod-tracing/)\n- [Building Advanced RAG with MLflow and LlamaIndex Workflow](https://mlflow.org/blog/mlflow-llama-index-workflow)\n","structuredPatch":[]}}

ElasticsearchStore(\n    es_url=\"http://localhost:9200\",\n    index_name=\"llama_index\"\n)\n\n# Build index\nstorage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"./data\").load_data()\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(\n    documents,\n    storage_context=storage_context\n)\n```\n\n### MongoDB Atlas\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, SimpleDirectoryReader\nfrom llama_index.vector_stores.mongodb import MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch\nfrom pymongo import MongoClient\n\n# Create MongoDB client\nmongo_client = MongoClient(\"your-connection-string\")\n\n# Create vector store\nvector_store = MongoDBAtlasVectorSearch(\n    mongo_client,\n    db_name=\"your_database\",\n    collection_name=\"your_collection\",\n    index_name=\"vector_index\"\n)\n\n# Build index\nstorage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)\ndocuments = SimpleDirectoryReader(\"./data\").load_data()\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(\n    documents,\n    storage_context=storage_context\n)\n```\n\n## Loading Data from Vector Stores\n\nLlamaIndex also supports loading existing data from vector stores using data connectors.\n\n### Chroma Data Loader\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.readers.chroma import ChromaReader\nimport chromadb\n\n# Create Chroma client\ndb = chromadb.PersistentClient(path=\"./chroma_db\")\ncollection = db.get_collection(\"my_collection\")\n\n# Load data\nreader = ChromaReader(collection=collection)\ndocuments = reader.load_data()\n```\n\n### Qdrant Data Loader\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.readers.qdrant import QdrantReader\nimport qdrant_client\n\n# Create Qdrant client\nclient = qdrant_client.QdrantClient(host=\"localhost\", port=6333)\n\n# Load data\nreader = QdrantReader(client=client)\ndocuments = reader.load_data(\n    collection_name=\"my_collection\",\n    limit=100\n)\n```\n\n### Pinecone Data Loader\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.readers.pinecone import PineconeReader\n\n# Create reader\nreader = PineconeReader(\n    api_key=\"your-api-key\",\n    environment=\"us-east-1-aws\"\n)\n\n# Load data with text mapping\nid_to_text_map = {\n    \"id1\": \"Document text 1\",\n    \"id2\": \"Document text 2\"\n}\n\ndocuments = reader.load_data(\n    index_name=\"your-index\",\n    id_to_text_map=id_to_text_map\n)\n```\n\n## Hybrid Search Examples\n\nMany vector stores support hybrid search combining vector similarity with keyword matching:\n\n### Pinecone Hybrid Search\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex\nfrom llama_index.vector_stores.pinecone import PineconeVectorStore\n\nvector_store = PineconeVectorStore(\n    pinecone_index=pinecone_index,\n    add_sparse_vector=True  # Enable hybrid search\n)\n\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(vector_store)\nquery_engine = index.as_query_engine(\n    vector_store_query_mode=\"hybrid\",\n    alpha=0.5  # Balance between dense and sparse\n)\n```\n\n### Qdrant Hybrid Search\n\n```python\nfrom llama_index.vector_stores.qdrant import QdrantVectorStore\n\nvector_store = QdrantVectorStore(\n    client=client,\n    collection_name=\"hybrid_collection\",\n    enable_hybrid=True\n)\n\nindex = VectorStoreIndex.from_vector_store(vector_store)\nquery_engine = index.as_query_engine(\n    vector_store_query_mode=\"hybrid\"\n)\n```\n\n## Best Practices\n\n1. **Choose the Right Vector Store**:\n   - For prototyping: Chroma, FAISS (local)\n   - For production: Pinecone, Qdrant, Weaviate (managed)\n   - For existing infrastructure: PostgreSQL with pgvector, Redis\n\n2. **Dimension Considerations**:\n   - Match vector dimensions to your embedding model\n   - Common dimensions: 384, 768, 1536, 3072\n\n3. **Indexing Strategy**:\n   - Use HNSW for fast approximate search\n   - Consider IVF for very large datasets\n   - Flat index for small datasets or exact search\n\n4. **Performance Optimization**:\n   - Batch document insertions\n   - Use async operations when available\n   - Configure appropriate index parameters\n\n5. **Metadata Filtering**:\n   - Store relevant metadata with vectors\n   - Use filters to narrow search space\n   - Combine with hybrid search for best results\n\n## Complete Example Notebooks\n\nLlamaIndex provides extensive example notebooks for each vector store integration:\n\n- [Pinecone

The service is ideal for processing jobs that don't require immediate responses. You can also [explore the API reference directly here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch).\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nWhile some uses of the OpenAI Platform require you to send synchronous requests, there are many cases where requests do not need an immediate response or [rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) prevent you from executing a large number of queries quickly. Batch processing jobs are often helpful in use cases like:\\n\\n1. Running evaluations\\n2. Classifying large datasets\\n3. Embedding content repositories\\n\\nThe Batch API offers a straightforward set of endpoints that allow you to collect a set of requests into a single file, kick off a batch processing job to execute these requests, query for the status of that batch while the underlying requests execute, and eventually retrieve the collected results when the batch is complete.\\n\\nCompared to using standard endpoints directly, Batch API has:\\n\\n1. **Better cost efficiency:** 50% cost discount compared to synchronous APIs\\n2. **Higher rate limits:** [Substantially more headroom](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) compared to the synchronous APIs\\n3. **Fast completion times:** Each batch completes within 24 hours (and often more quickly)\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Prepare your batch file\\n\\nBatches start with a `.jsonl` file where each line contains the details of an individual request to the API. For now, the available endpoints are `/v1/responses` ( [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses)), `/v1/chat/completions` ( [Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)), `/v1/embeddings` ( [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)), and `/v1/completions` ( [Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)). For a given input file, the parameters in each line's `body` field are the same as the parameters for the underlying endpoint. Each request must include a unique `custom_id` value, which you can use to reference results after completion. Here's an example of an input file with 2 requests. Note that each input file can only include requests to a single model.\\n\\n```jsonl\\n{\\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-1\\\", \\\"method\\\": \\\"POST\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/v1/chat/completions\\\", \\\"body\\\": {\\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\\\", \\\"messages\\\": [{\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"You are a helpful assistant.\\\"},{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Hello world!\\\"}],\\\"max_tokens\\\": 1000}}\\n{\\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-2\\\", \\\"method\\\": \\\"POST\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/v1/chat/completions\\\", \\\"body\\\": {\\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\\\", \\\"messages\\\": [{\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"You are an unhelpful assistant.\\\"},{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Hello world!\\\"}],\\\"max_tokens\\\": 1000}}\\n```\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Upload your batch input file\\n\\nSimilar to our [Fine-tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization), you must first upload your input file so that you can reference it correctly when kicking off batches. Upload your `.jsonl` file using the [Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files).\\n\\nUpload files for Batch API\\n\\njavascript\\n\\n```javascript\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\nimport OpenAI from \\\"openai\\\";\\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\\n\\nconst file = await openai.files.create({\\n  file: fs.createReadStream(\\\"batchinput.jsonl\\\"),\\n  purpose: \\\"batch\\\",\\n});\\n\\nconsole.log(file);\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nbatch_input_file = client.files.create(\\n    file=open(\\\"batchinput.jsonl\\\", \\\"rb\\\"),\\n    purpose=\\\"batch\\\"\\n)\\n\\nprint(batch_input_file)\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -F purpose=\\\"batch\\\" \\\\\\n  -F file=\\\"@batchinput.jsonl\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Create the batch\\n\\nOnce you've successfully uploaded your input file, you can use the input File object's ID to create a batch. In this case, let's assume the file ID is `file-abc123`. For now, the completion window can only be set to `24h`.

Cancel a batch\\n\\nIf necessary, you can cancel an ongoing batch. The batch's status will change to `cancelling` until in-flight requests are complete (up to 10 minutes), after which the status will change to `cancelled`.\\n\\nCancelling a batch\\n\\njavascript\\n\\n```javascript\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nimport OpenAI from \\\"openai\\\";\\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\\n\\nconst batch = await openai.batches.cancel(\\\"batch_abc123\\\");\\nconsole.log(batch);\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nclient.batches.cancel(\\\"batch_abc123\\\")\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches/batch_abc123/cancel \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n  -X POST\\n```\\n\\n### 7\\\\. Get a list of all batches\\n\\nAt any time, you can see all your batches. For users with many batches, you can use the `limit` and `after` parameters to paginate your results.\\n\\nGetting a list of all batches\\n\\njavascript\\n\\n```javascript\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\nimport OpenAI from \\\"openai\\\";\\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\\n\\nconst list = await openai.batches.list();\\n\\nfor await (const batch of list) {\\n  console.log(batch);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nclient.batches.list(limit=10)\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches?limit=10 \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Model availability\\n\\nThe Batch API is widely available across most of our models, but not all. Please refer to the [model reference docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to ensure the model you're using supports the Batch API.\\n\\n## Rate limits\\n\\nBatch API rate limits are separate from existing per-model rate limits. The Batch API has two new types of rate limits:\\n\\n1. **Per-batch limits:** A single batch may include up to 50,000 requests, and a batch input file can be up to 200 MB in size. Note that `/v1/embeddings` batches are also restricted to a maximum of 50,000 embedding inputs across all requests in the batch.\\n2. **Enqueued prompt tokens per model:** Each model has a maximum number of enqueued prompt tokens allowed for batch processing. You can find these limits on the [Platform Settings page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).\\n\\nThere are no limits for output tokens or number of submitted requests for the Batch API today. Because Batch API rate limits are a new, separate pool, **using the Batch API will not consume tokens from your standard per-model rate limits**, thereby offering you a convenient way to increase the number of requests and processed tokens you can use when querying our API.\\n\\n## Batch expiration\\n\\nBatches that do not complete in time eventually move to an `expired` state; unfinished requests within that batch are cancelled, and any responses to completed requests are made available via the batch's output file. You will be charged for tokens consumed from any completed requests.\\n\\nExpired requests will be written to your error file with the message as shown below. You can use the `custom_id` to retrieve the request data for expired requests.\\n\\n```jsonl\\n{\\\"id\\\": \\\"batch_req_123\\\", \\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-3\\\", \\\"response\\\": null, \\\"error\\\": {\\\"code\\\": \\\"batch_expired\\\", \\\"message\\\": \\\"This request could not be executed before the completion window expired.\\\"}}\\n{\\\"id\\\": \\\"batch_req_123\\\", \\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-7\\\", \\\"response\\\": null, \\\"error\\\": {\\\"code\\\": \\\"batch_expired\\\", \\\"message\\\": \\\"This request could not be executed before the completion window expired.\\\"}}\\n```\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"twitter:domain\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n    \"twitter:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogUrl\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogTitle\": \"Batch API - OpenAI API\",\n    \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n    \"twitter:title\": \"Batch API - OpenAI API\",\n    \"og:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"favicon\": \"https://platform.openai.com/favicon-platform.png\",\n    \"ogDescription\": \"Learn how to use OpenAI's Batch API for processing jobs with asynchronous requests, increased rate limits, and cost efficiency.\",\n    \"description\": \"Learn how to use OpenAI's Batch API for processing jobs with asynchronous requests, increased rate limits, and cost efficiency.\",\n    \"og:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\n    \"og:type\": \"website\",\n    \"theme-color\": \"#000000\",\n    \"title\": \"Batch API - OpenAI API\",\n    \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n    \"twitter:description\": \"Learn how to use OpenAI's Batch API for processing jobs with asynchronous requests, increased rate limits, and cost efficiency.\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"twitter:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"og:description\": \"Learn how to use OpenAI's Batch API for processing jobs with asynchronous requests, increased rate limits, and cost efficiency.\",\n    \"og:title\": \"Batch API - OpenAI API\",\n    \"scrapeId\": \"93636f0f-4494-414f-9982-aa78e767cb60\",\n    \"sourceURL\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch\",\n    \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n    \"proxyUsed\": \"basic\",\n    \"cacheState\": \"hit\",\n    \"cachedAt\": \"2025-10-03T23:21:41.182Z\",\n    \"creditsUsed\": 1\n  }\n}"}]}]},"uuid":"d19a403c-bf9a-4218-82bb-84b92f378a3f","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:33:48.952Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"{\n  \"markdown\": \"Log in [Sign up](https://platform.openai.com/signup)\\n\\n# Batch API\\n\\nProcess jobs asynchronously with Batch API.\\n\\nCopy page\\n\\nLearn how to use OpenAI's Batch API to send asynchronous groups of requests with 50% lower costs, a separate pool of significantly higher rate limits, and a clear 24-hour turnaround time. The service is ideal for processing jobs that don't require immediate responses. You can also [explore the API reference directly here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch).\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nWhile some uses of the OpenAI Platform require you to send synchronous requests, there are many cases where requests do not need an immediate response or [rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) prevent you from executing a large number of queries quickly. Batch processing jobs are often helpful in use cases like:\\n\\n1. Running evaluations\\n2. Classifying large datasets\\n3. Embedding content repositories\\n\\nThe Batch API offers a straightforward set of endpoints that allow you to collect a set of requests into a single file, kick off a batch processing job to execute these requests, query for the status of that batch while the underlying requests execute, and eventually retrieve the collected results when the batch is complete.\\n\\nCompared to using standard endpoints directly, Batch API has:\\n\\n1. **Better cost efficiency:** 50% cost discount compared to synchronous APIs\\n2. **Higher rate limits:** [Substantially more headroom](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) compared to the synchronous APIs\\n3. **Fast completion times:** Each batch completes within 24 hours (and often more quickly)\\n\\n## Getting started\\n\\n### 1\\\\. Prepare your batch file\\n\\nBatches start with a `.jsonl` file where each line contains the details of an individual request to the API. For now, the available endpoints are `/v1/responses` ( [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses)), `/v1/chat/completions` ( [Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)), `/v1/embeddings` ( [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)), and `/v1/completions` ( [Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)). For a given input file, the parameters in each line's `body` field are the same as the parameters for the underlying endpoint. Each request must include a unique `custom_id` value, which you can use to reference results after completion. Here's an example of an input file with 2 requests. Note that each input file can only include requests to a single model.\\n\\n```jsonl\\n{\\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-1\\\", \\\"method\\\": \\\"POST\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/v1/chat/completions\\\", \\\"body\\\": {\\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\\\", \\\"messages\\\": [{\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"You are a helpful assistant.\\\"},{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Hello world!\\\"}],\\\"max_tokens\\\": 1000}}\\n{\\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-2\\\", \\\"method\\\": \\\"POST\\\", \\\"url\\\": \\\"/v1/chat/completions\\\", \\\"body\\\": {\\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\\\", \\\"messages\\\": [{\\\"role\\\": \\\"system\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"You are an unhelpful assistant.\\\"},{\\\"role\\\": \\\"user\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Hello world!\\\"}],\\\"max_tokens\\\": 1000}}\\n```\\n\\n### 2\\\\. Upload your batch input file\\n\\nSimilar to our [Fine-tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization), you must first upload your input file so that you can reference it correctly when kicking off batches. Upload your `.jsonl` file using the [Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files).\\n\\nUpload files for Batch API\\n\\njavascript\\n\\n```javascript\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\nimport fs from \\\"fs\\\";\\nimport OpenAI from \\\"openai\\\";\\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\\n\\nconst file = await openai.files.create({\\n  file: fs.createReadStream(\\\"batchinput.jsonl\\\"),\\n  purpose: \\\"batch\\\",\\n});\\n\\nconsole.log(file);\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nbatch_input_file = client.files.create(\\n    file=open(\\\"batchinput.jsonl\\\", \\\"rb\\\"),\\n    purpose=\\\"batch\\\"\\n)\\n\\nprint(batch_input_file)\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -F purpose=\\\"batch\\\" \\\\\\n  -F file=\\\"@batchinput.jsonl\\\"\\n```\\n\\n### 3\\\\. Create the batch\\n\\nOnce you've successfully uploaded your input file, you can use the input File object's ID to create a batch. In this case, let's assume the file ID is `file-abc123`.

Instead of\\nrelying on order to process your results, use the custom\\\\_id field which will be\\npresent in each line of your output file and allow you to map requests in your input\\nto results in your output.\\n\\n```jsonl\\n{\\\"id\\\": \\\"batch_req_123\\\", \\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-2\\\", \\\"response\\\": {\\\"status_code\\\": 200, \\\"request_id\\\": \\\"req_123\\\", \\\"body\\\": {\\\"id\\\": \\\"chatcmpl-123\\\", \\\"object\\\": \\\"chat.completion\\\", \\\"created\\\": 1711652795, \\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\\\", \\\"choices\\\": [{\\\"index\\\": 0, \\\"message\\\": {\\\"role\\\": \\\"assistant\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Hello.\\\"}, \\\"logprobs\\\": null, \\\"finish_reason\\\": \\\"stop\\\"}], \\\"usage\\\": {\\\"prompt_tokens\\\": 22, \\\"completion_tokens\\\": 2, \\\"total_tokens\\\": 24}, \\\"system_fingerprint\\\": \\\"fp_123\\\"}}, \\\"error\\\": null}\\n{\\\"id\\\": \\\"batch_req_456\\\", \\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-1\\\", \\\"response\\\": {\\\"status_code\\\": 200, \\\"request_id\\\": \\\"req_789\\\", \\\"body\\\": {\\\"id\\\": \\\"chatcmpl-abc\\\", \\\"object\\\": \\\"chat.completion\\\", \\\"created\\\": 1711652789, \\\"model\\\": \\\"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\\\", \\\"choices\\\": [{\\\"index\\\": 0, \\\"message\\\": {\\\"role\\\": \\\"assistant\\\", \\\"content\\\": \\\"Hello!

Cancel a batch\\n\\nIf necessary, you can cancel an ongoing batch. The batch's status will change to `cancelling` until in-flight requests are complete (up to 10 minutes), after which the status will change to `cancelled`.\\n\\nCancelling a batch\\n\\njavascript\\n\\n```javascript\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\nimport OpenAI from \\\"openai\\\";\\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\\n\\nconst batch = await openai.batches.cancel(\\\"batch_abc123\\\");\\nconsole.log(batch);\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nclient.batches.cancel(\\\"batch_abc123\\\")\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches/batch_abc123/cancel \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\" \\\\\\n  -X POST\\n```\\n\\n### 7\\\\. Get a list of all batches\\n\\nAt any time, you can see all your batches. For users with many batches, you can use the `limit` and `after` parameters to paginate your results.\\n\\nGetting a list of all batches\\n\\njavascript\\n\\n```javascript\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\nimport OpenAI from \\\"openai\\\";\\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\\n\\nconst list = await openai.batches.list();\\n\\nfor await (const batch of list) {\\n  console.log(batch);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```python\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\nfrom openai import OpenAI\\nclient = OpenAI()\\n\\nclient.batches.list(limit=10)\\n```\\n\\n```bash\\n1\\n2\\n3\\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches?limit=10 \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\\\" \\\\\\n  -H \\\"Content-Type: application/json\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Model availability\\n\\nThe Batch API is widely available across most of our models, but not all. Please refer to the [model reference docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to ensure the model you're using supports the Batch API.\\n\\n## Rate limits\\n\\nBatch API rate limits are separate from existing per-model rate limits. The Batch API has two new types of rate limits:\\n\\n1. **Per-batch limits:** A single batch may include up to 50,000 requests, and a batch input file can be up to 200 MB in size. Note that `/v1/embeddings` batches are also restricted to a maximum of 50,000 embedding inputs across all requests in the batch.\\n2. **Enqueued prompt tokens per model:** Each model has a maximum number of enqueued prompt tokens allowed for batch processing. You can find these limits on the [Platform Settings page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).\\n\\nThere are no limits for output tokens or number of submitted requests for the Batch API today. Because Batch API rate limits are a new, separate pool, **using the Batch API will not consume tokens from your standard per-model rate limits**, thereby offering you a convenient way to increase the number of requests and processed tokens you can use when querying our API.\\n\\n## Batch expiration\\n\\nBatches that do not complete in time eventually move to an `expired` state; unfinished requests within that batch are cancelled, and any responses to completed requests are made available via the batch's output file. You will be charged for tokens consumed from any completed requests.\\n\\nExpired requests will be written to your error file with the message as shown below. You can use the `custom_id` to retrieve the request data for expired requests.\\n\\n```jsonl\\n{\\\"id\\\": \\\"batch_req_123\\\", \\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-3\\\", \\\"response\\\": null, \\\"error\\\": {\\\"code\\\": \\\"batch_expired\\\", \\\"message\\\": \\\"This request could not be executed before the completion window expired.\\\"}}\\n{\\\"id\\\": \\\"batch_req_123\\\", \\\"custom_id\\\": \\\"request-7\\\", \\\"response\\\": null, \\\"error\\\": {\\\"code\\\": \\\"batch_expired\\\", \\\"message\\\": \\\"This request could not be executed before the completion window expired.\\\"}}\\n```\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"twitter:domain\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n    \"twitter:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogUrl\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogTitle\": \"Batch API - OpenAI API\",\n    \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n    \"twitter:title\": \"Batch API - OpenAI API\",\n    \"og:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"favicon\": \"https://platform.openai.com/favicon-platform.png\",\n    \"ogDescription\": \"Learn how to use OpenAI's Batch API for processing jobs with asynchronous requests, increased rate limits, and cost efficiency.\",\n    \"description\": \"Learn how to use OpenAI's Batch API for processing jobs with asynchronous requests, increased rate limits, and cost efficiency.\",\n    \"og:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\n    \"og:type\": \"website\",\n    \"theme-color\": \"#000000\",\n    \"title\": \"Batch API - OpenAI API\",\n    \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n    \"twitter:description\": \"Learn how to use OpenAI's Batch API for processing jobs with asynchronous requests, increased rate limits, and cost efficiency.\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"twitter:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"og:description\": \"Learn how to use OpenAI's Batch API for processing jobs with asynchronous requests, increased rate limits, and cost efficiency.\",\n    \"og:title\": \"Batch API - OpenAI API\",\n    \"scrapeId\": \"93636f0f-4494-414f-9982-aa78e767cb60\",\n    \"sourceURL\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch\",\n    \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/batch\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n    \"proxyUsed\": \"basic\",\n    \"cacheState\": \"hit\",\n    \"cachedAt\": \"2025-10-03T23:21:41.182Z\",\n    \"creditsUsed\": 1\n  }\n}"}]}

The result is a customized model that more reliably produces your desired style and content.\\n\\n| How it works | Best for | Use with |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| Provide examples of correct responses to prompts to guide the model's behavior.<br>Often uses human-generated \\\"ground truth\\\" responses to show the model how it should respond. | - Classification<br>- Nuanced translation<br>- Generating content in a specific format<br>- Correcting instruction-following failures | `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` `gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14` `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14` |\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nSupervised fine-tuning has four major parts:\\n\\n1. Build your training dataset to determine what \\\"good\\\" looks like\\n2. Upload a training dataset containing example prompts and desired model output\\n3. Create a fine-tuning job for a base model using your training data\\n4. Evaluate your results using the fine-tuned model\\n\\n**Good evals first!** Only invest in fine-tuning after setting up evals. You need a\\nreliable way to determine whether your fine-tuned model is performing better than a\\nbase model.\\n\\n[Set up evals →](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals)\\n\\n## Build your dataset\\n\\nBuild a robust, representative dataset to get useful results from a fine-tuned model. Use the following techniques and considerations.\\n\\n### Right number of examples\\n\\n- The minimum number of examples you can provide for fine-tuning is 10\\n- We see improvements from fine-tuning on 50–100 examples, but the right number for you varies greatly and depends on the use case\\n- We recommend starting with 50 well-crafted demonstrations and [evaluating the results](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals)\\n\\nIf performance improves with 50 good examples, try adding examples to see further results. If 50 examples have no impact, rethink your task or prompt before adding training data.\\n\\n### What makes a good example\\n\\n- Whatever prompts and outputs you expect in your application, as realistic as possible\\n- Specific, clear questions and answers\\n- Use historical data, expert data, logged data, or [other types of collected data](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals)\\n\\n### Formatting your data\\n\\n- Use [JSONL format](https://jsonlines.org/), with one complete JSON structure on every line of the training data file\\n- Use the [chat completions format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input)\\n- Your file must have at least 10 lines\\n\\nJSONL format example fileCorresponding JSON data\\n\\nJSONL format example file\\n\\nAn example of JSONL training data, where the model calls a `get_weather` function:\\n\\n```text\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n{\\\"messages\\\":[{\\\"role\\\":\\\"user\\\",\\\"content\\\":\\\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\\\"},{\\\"role\\\":\\\"assistant\\\",\\\"tool_calls\\\":[{\\\"id\\\":\\\"call_id\\\",\\\"type\\\":\\\"function\\\",\\\"function\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"get_current_weather\\\",\\\"arguments\\\":\\\"{\\\\\\\"location\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"San Francisco, USA\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"format\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"celsius\\\\\\\"}\\\"}}]}],\\\"parallel_tool_calls\\\":false,\\\"tools\\\":[{\\\"type\\\":\\\"function\\\",\\\"function\\\":{\\\"name\\\":\\\"get_current_weather\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"Get the current weather\\\",\\\"parameters\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"object\\\",\\\"properties\\\":{\\\"location\\\":{\\\"type\\\":\\\"string\\\",\\\"description\\\":\\\"The city and country, eg.

The general flow of this technique is:\\n\\n- Tune a prompt for a larger model (like `gpt-4.1`) until you get great performance against your eval criteria.\\n- Capture results generated from your model using whatever technique is convenient - note that the [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) stores model responses for 30 days by default.\\n- Use the captured responses from the large model that fit your criteria to generate a dataset using the tools and techniques described above.\\n- Tune a smaller model (like `gpt-4.1-mini`) using the dataset you created from the large model.\\n\\nThis technique can enable you to train a small model to perform similarly on a specific task to a larger, more costly model.\\n\\n## Upload training data\\n\\nUpload your dataset of examples to OpenAI. We use it to update the model's weights and produce outputs like the ones included in your data.\\n\\nIn addition to text completions, you can train the model to more effectively generate [structured JSON output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) or [function calls](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).\\n\\nUpload your data with button clicksCall the API to upload your data\\n\\nUpload your data with button clicks\\n\\n1.

When creating a fine-tuning job, you must specify:\\n\\n- A base model ( `model`) to use for fine-tuning. This can be either an OpenAI model ID or the ID of a previously fine-tuned model. See which models support fine-tuning in the [model docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).\\n- A training file ( `training_file`) ID. This is the file you uploaded in the previous step.\\n- A fine-tuning method ( `method`). This specifies which fine-tuning method you want to use to customize the model. Supervised fine-tuning is the default.\\n\\nUpload your data with button clicksCall the API to upload your data\\n\\nUpload your data with button clicks\\n\\n1. In the same **\\\\+ Create** modal as above, complete the required fields.\\n2. Select supervised fine-tuning as the method and whichever model you want to train.\\n3.

Adjust your prompts, data, and fine-tuning job as needed until you get the results you want. The best way to fine-tune is to continue iterating.\\n\\n### Compare to evals\\n\\nTo see if your fine-tuned model performs better than the original base model, [use evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals). Before running your fine-tuning job, carve out data from the same training dataset you collected in step 1. This holdout data acts as a control group when you use it for evals. Make sure the training and holdout data have roughly the same diversity of user input types and model responses.\\n\\n[Learn more about running evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals).\\n\\n### Monitor the status\\n\\nCheck the status of a fine-tuning job in the dashboard or by polling the job ID in the API.\\n\\nMonitor in the UIMonitor with API calls\\n\\nMonitor in the UI\\n\\n1.

When the fine-tuned model finishes training, use its ID in either the [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) or [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) API, just as you would an OpenAI base model.\\n\\nUse your model in the PlaygroundUse your model with an API call\\n\\nUse your model in the Playground\\n\\n1. Navigate to your fine-tuning job in [the dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune).\\n2. In the right pane, navigate to **Output model** and copy the model ID. It should start with `ft:…`\\n3. Open the [Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).\\n4. In the **Model** dropdown menu, paste the model ID. Here, you should also see other fine-tuned models you've created.\\n5.

We create a full model checkpoint for you at the end of each training epoch. They're useful in cases where your fine-tuned model improves early on but then memorizes the dataset instead of learning generalizable knowledge—called \\\\_overfitting. Checkpoints provide versions of your customized model from various moments in the process.\\n\\nFind checkpoints in the dashboardQuery the API for checkpoints\\n\\nFind checkpoints in the dashboard\\n\\n1. Navigate to the [fine-tuning dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune).\\n2. In the left panel, select the job you want to investigate. Wait until it succeeds.\\n3. In the right panel, scroll to the list of checkpoints.\\n4. Hover over any checkpoint to see a link to launch in the Playground.\\n5. Test the checkpoint model's behavior by prompting it in the Playground.\\n\\nQuery the API for checkpoints\\n\\n1. Wait until a job succeeds, which you can verify by [querying the status of a job](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/retrieve).\\n2. [Query the checkpoints endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list-checkpoints) with your fine-tuning job ID to access a list of model checkpoints for the fine-tuning job.\\n3. Find the `fine_tuned_model_checkpoint` field for the name of the model checkpoint.\\n4. Use this model just like you would the final fine-tuned model.\\n\\nThe checkpoint object contains `metrics` data to help you determine the usefulness of this model. As an example, the response looks like this:\\n\\n```json\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n{\\n  \\\"object\\\": \\\"fine_tuning.job.checkpoint\\\",\\n  \\\"id\\\": \\\"ftckpt_zc4Q7MP6XxulcVzj4MZdwsAB\\\",\\n  \\\"created_at\\\": 1519129973,\\n  \\\"fine_tuned_model_checkpoint\\\": \\\"ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:my-org:custom-suffix:96olL566:ckpt-step-2000\\\",\\n  \\\"metrics\\\": {\\n    \\\"full_valid_loss\\\": 0.134,\\n    \\\"full_valid_mean_token_accuracy\\\": 0.874\\n  },\\n  \\\"fine_tuning_job_id\\\": \\\"ftjob-abc123\\\",\\n  \\\"step_number\\\": 2000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nEach checkpoint specifies:\\n\\n- `step_number`: The step at which the checkpoint was created (where each epoch is number of steps in the training set divided by the batch size)\\n- `metrics`: An object containing the metrics for your fine-tuning job at the step when the checkpoint was created\\n\\nCurrently, only the checkpoints for the last three epochs of the job are saved and available for use.\\n\\n## Safety checks\\n\\nBefore launching in production, review and follow the following safety information.\\n\\nHow we assess for safety\\n\\nOnce a fine-tuning job is completed, we assess the resulting model’s behavior across 13 distinct safety categories. Each category represents a critical area where AI outputs could potentially cause harm if not properly controlled.\\n\\n| Name | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| advice | Advice or guidance that violates our policies. |\\n| harassment/threatening | Harassment content that also includes violence or serious harm towards any target. |\\n| hate | Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. Hateful content aimed at non-protected groups (e.g., chess players) is harassment. |\\n| hate/threatening | Hateful content that also includes violence or serious harm towards the targeted group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. |\\n| highly-sensitive | Highly sensitive data that violates our policies. |\\n| illicit | Content that gives advice or instruction on how to commit illicit acts. A phrase like \\\"how to shoplift\\\" would fit this category. |\\n| propaganda | Praise or assistance for ideology that violates our policies. |\\n| self-harm/instructions | Content that encourages performing acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders, or that gives instructions or advice on how to commit such acts. |\\n| self-harm/intent | Content where the speaker expresses that they are engaging or intend to engage in acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders. |\\n| sensitive | Sensitive data that violates our policies. |\\n| sexual/minors | Sexual content that includes an individual who is under 18 years old. |\\n| sexual | Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness). |\\n| violence | Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury. |\\n\\nEach category has a predefined pass threshold; if too many evaluated examples in a given category fail, OpenAI blocks the fine-tuned model from deployment. If your fine-tuned model does not pass the safety checks, OpenAI sends a message in the fine-tuning job explaining which categories don't meet the required thresholds. You can view the results in the moderation checks section of the fine-tuning job.\\n\\nHow to pass safety checks\\n\\nIn addition to reviewing any failed safety checks in the fine-tuning job object, you can retrieve details about which categories failed by querying the [fine-tuning API events endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list-events). Look for events of type `moderation_checks` for details about category results and enforcement. This information can help you narrow down which categories to target for retraining and improvement. The [model spec](https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#overview) has rules and examples that can help identify areas for additional training data.\\n\\nWhile these evaluations cover a broad range of safety categories, conduct your own evaluations of the fine-tuned model to ensure it's appropriate for your use case.\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nNow that you know the basics of supervised fine-tuning, explore these other methods as well.\\n\\n[Vision fine-tuning\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nLearn to fine-tune for computer vision with image inputs.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision-fine-tuning) [Direct preference optimization\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nFine-tune a model using direct preference optimization (DPO).](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/direct-preference-optimization) [Reinforcement fine-tuning\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nFine-tune a reasoning model by grading its outputs.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reinforcement-fine-tuning)\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"ogDescription\": \"Learn how to fine-tune models to get better results and lower latency with the OpenAI API.\",\n    \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n    \"twitter:domain\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n    \"theme-color\": \"#000000\",\n    \"twitter:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"title\": \"Supervised fine-tuning - OpenAI API\",\n    \"favicon\": \"https://platform.openai.com/favicon-platform.png\",\n    \"description\": \"Learn how to fine-tune models to get better results and lower latency with the OpenAI API.\",\n    \"twitter:title\": \"Supervised fine-tuning - OpenAI API\",\n    \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n    \"twitter:description\": \"Learn how to fine-tune models to get better results and lower latency with the OpenAI API.\",\n    \"ogTitle\": \"Supervised fine-tuning - OpenAI API\",\n    \"ogUrl\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"og:type\": \"website\",\n    \"twitter:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\n    \"og:title\": \"Supervised fine-tuning - OpenAI API\",\n    \"og:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"og:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"og:description\": \"Learn how to fine-tune models to get better results and lower latency with the OpenAI API.\",\n    \"scrapeId\": \"c6d99668-6e20-4965-af52-ec72de9510a6\",\n    \"sourceURL\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/supervised-fine-tuning\",\n    \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/supervised-fine-tuning#distilling-from-a-larger-model\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n    \"proxyUsed\": \"basic\",\n    \"cacheState\": \"hit\",\n    \"cachedAt\": \"2025-10-02T23:11:31.986Z\",\n    \"creditsUsed\": 1\n  }\n}"}]}]},"uuid":"bdde04ed-2de9-4ae7-8ea2-bb4515a3600e","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:33:58.909Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"{\n  \"markdown\": \"Log in [Sign up](https://platform.openai.com/signup)\\n\\n# Supervised fine-tuning\\n\\nFine-tune models with example inputs and known good outputs for better results and efficiency.\\n\\nCopy page\\n\\nSupervised fine-tuning (SFT) lets you train an OpenAI model with examples for your specific use case.

The general flow of this technique is:\\n\\n- Tune a prompt for a larger model (like `gpt-4.1`) until you get great performance against your eval criteria.\\n- Capture results generated from your model using whatever technique is convenient - note that the [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) stores model responses for 30 days by default.\\n- Use the captured responses from the large model that fit your criteria to generate a dataset using the tools and techniques described above.\\n- Tune a smaller model (like `gpt-4.1-mini`) using the dataset you created from the large model.\\n\\nThis technique can enable you to train a small model to perform similarly on a specific task to a larger, more costly model.\\n\\n## Upload training data\\n\\nUpload your dataset of examples to OpenAI. We use it to update the model's weights and produce outputs like the ones included in your data.\\n\\nIn addition to text completions, you can train the model to more effectively generate [structured JSON output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) or [function calls](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).\\n\\nUpload your data with button clicksCall the API to upload your data\\n\\nUpload your data with button clicks\\n\\n1.

See which models support fine-tuning in the [model docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).\\n- A training file ( `training_file`) ID. This is the file you uploaded in the previous step.\\n- A fine-tuning method ( `method`). This specifies which fine-tuning method you want to use to customize the model.

Adjust your prompts, data, and fine-tuning job as needed until you get the results you want. The best way to fine-tune is to continue iterating.\\n\\n### Compare to evals\\n\\nTo see if your fine-tuned model performs better than the original base model, [use evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals). Before running your fine-tuning job, carve out data from the same training dataset you collected in step 1. This holdout data acts as a control group when you use it for evals. Make sure the training and holdout data have roughly the same diversity of user input types and model responses.\\n\\n[Learn more about running evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals).\\n\\n### Monitor the status\\n\\nCheck the status of a fine-tuning job in the dashboard or by polling the job ID in the API.\\n\\nMonitor in the UIMonitor with API calls\\n\\nMonitor in the UI\\n\\n1.

When the fine-tuned model finishes training, use its ID in either the [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) or [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) API, just as you would an OpenAI base model.\\n\\nUse your model in the PlaygroundUse your model with an API call\\n\\nUse your model in the Playground\\n\\n1. Navigate to your fine-tuning job in [the dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune).\\n2. In the right pane, navigate to **Output model** and copy the model ID. It should start with `ft:…`\\n3. Open the [Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).\\n4. In the **Model** dropdown menu, paste the model ID. Here, you should also see other fine-tuned models you've created.\\n5.

We create a full model checkpoint for you at the end of each training epoch. They're useful in cases where your fine-tuned model improves early on but then memorizes the dataset instead of learning generalizable knowledge—called \\\\_overfitting. Checkpoints provide versions of your customized model from various moments in the process.\\n\\nFind checkpoints in the dashboardQuery the API for checkpoints\\n\\nFind checkpoints in the dashboard\\n\\n1. Navigate to the [fine-tuning dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune).\\n2. In the left panel, select the job you want to investigate. Wait until it succeeds.\\n3. In the right panel, scroll to the list of checkpoints.\\n4. Hover over any checkpoint to see a link to launch in the Playground.\\n5. Test the checkpoint model's behavior by prompting it in the Playground.\\n\\nQuery the API for checkpoints\\n\\n1. Wait until a job succeeds, which you can verify by [querying the status of a job](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/retrieve).\\n2. [Query the checkpoints endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list-checkpoints) with your fine-tuning job ID to access a list of model checkpoints for the fine-tuning job.\\n3. Find the `fine_tuned_model_checkpoint` field for the name of the model checkpoint.\\n4. Use this model just like you would the final fine-tuned model.\\n\\nThe checkpoint object contains `metrics` data to help you determine the usefulness of this model. As an example, the response looks like this:\\n\\n```json\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n4\\n5\\n6\\n7\\n8\\n9\\n10\\n11\\n12\\n{\\n  \\\"object\\\": \\\"fine_tuning.job.checkpoint\\\",\\n  \\\"id\\\": \\\"ftckpt_zc4Q7MP6XxulcVzj4MZdwsAB\\\",\\n  \\\"created_at\\\": 1519129973,\\n  \\\"fine_tuned_model_checkpoint\\\": \\\"ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:my-org:custom-suffix:96olL566:ckpt-step-2000\\\",\\n  \\\"metrics\\\": {\\n    \\\"full_valid_loss\\\": 0.134,\\n    \\\"full_valid_mean_token_accuracy\\\": 0.874\\n  },\\n  \\\"fine_tuning_job_id\\\": \\\"ftjob-abc123\\\",\\n  \\\"step_number\\\": 2000\\n}\\n```\\n\\nEach checkpoint specifies:\\n\\n- `step_number`: The step at which the checkpoint was created (where each epoch is number of steps in the training set divided by the batch size)\\n- `metrics`: An object containing the metrics for your fine-tuning job at the step when the checkpoint was created\\n\\nCurrently, only the checkpoints for the last three epochs of the job are saved and available for use.\\n\\n## Safety checks\\n\\nBefore launching in production, review and follow the following safety information.\\n\\nHow we assess for safety\\n\\nOnce a fine-tuning job is completed, we assess the resulting model’s behavior across 13 distinct safety categories. Each category represents a critical area where AI outputs could potentially cause harm if not properly controlled.\\n\\n| Name | Description |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| advice | Advice or guidance that violates our policies. |\\n| harassment/threatening | Harassment content that also includes violence or serious harm towards any target. |\\n| hate | Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. Hateful content aimed at non-protected groups (e.g., chess players) is harassment. |\\n| hate/threatening | Hateful content that also includes violence or serious harm towards the targeted group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. |\\n| highly-sensitive | Highly sensitive data that violates our policies. |\\n| illicit | Content that gives advice or instruction on how to commit illicit acts. A phrase like \\\"how to shoplift\\\" would fit this category. |\\n| propaganda | Praise or assistance for ideology that violates our policies. |\\n| self-harm/instructions | Content that encourages performing acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders, or that gives instructions or advice on how to commit such acts. |\\n| self-harm/intent | Content where the speaker expresses that they are engaging or intend to engage in acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders. |\\n| sensitive | Sensitive data that violates our policies. |\\n| sexual/minors | Sexual content that includes an individual who is under 18 years old. |\\n| sexual | Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness). |\\n| violence | Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury. |\\n\\nEach category has a predefined pass threshold; if too many evaluated examples in a given category fail, OpenAI blocks the fine-tuned model from deployment. If your fine-tuned model does not pass the safety checks, OpenAI sends a message in the fine-tuning job explaining which categories don't meet the required thresholds. You can view the results in the moderation checks section of the fine-tuning job.\\n\\nHow to pass safety checks\\n\\nIn addition to reviewing any failed safety checks in the fine-tuning job object, you can retrieve details about which categories failed by querying the [fine-tuning API events endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list-events). Look for events of type `moderation_checks` for details about category results and enforcement. This information can help you narrow down which categories to target for retraining and improvement. The [model spec](https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#overview) has rules and examples that can help identify areas for additional training data.\\n\\nWhile these evaluations cover a broad range of safety categories, conduct your own evaluations of the fine-tuned model to ensure it's appropriate for your use case.\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nNow that you know the basics of supervised fine-tuning, explore these other methods as well.\\n\\n[Vision fine-tuning\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nLearn to fine-tune for computer vision with image inputs.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision-fine-tuning) [Direct preference optimization\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nFine-tune a model using direct preference optimization (DPO).](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/direct-preference-optimization) [Reinforcement fine-tuning\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nFine-tune a reasoning model by grading its outputs.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reinforcement-fine-tuning)\",\n  \"metadata\": {\n    \"ogDescription\": \"Learn how to fine-tune models to get better results and lower latency with the OpenAI API.\",\n    \"viewport\": \"width=device-width, initial-scale=1\",\n    \"twitter:domain\": \"platform.openai.com\",\n    \"theme-color\": \"#000000\",\n    \"twitter:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"title\": \"Supervised fine-tuning - OpenAI API\",\n    \"favicon\": \"https://platform.openai.com/favicon-platform.png\",\n    \"description\": \"Learn how to fine-tune models to get better results and lower latency with the OpenAI API.\",\n    \"twitter:title\": \"Supervised fine-tuning - OpenAI API\",\n    \"twitter:card\": \"summary_large_image\",\n    \"twitter:description\": \"Learn how to fine-tune models to get better results and lower latency with the OpenAI API.\",\n    \"ogTitle\": \"Supervised fine-tuning - OpenAI API\",\n    \"ogUrl\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"og:type\": \"website\",\n    \"twitter:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"language\": \"en-US\",\n    \"og:title\": \"Supervised fine-tuning - OpenAI API\",\n    \"og:image\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"og:url\": \"https://platform.openai.com\",\n    \"ogImage\": \"https://cdn.openai.com/API/images/platform-opengraph.png\",\n    \"og:description\": \"Learn how to fine-tune models to get better results and lower latency with the OpenAI API.\",\n    \"scrapeId\": \"c6d99668-6e20-4965-af52-ec72de9510a6\",\n    \"sourceURL\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/supervised-fine-tuning\",\n    \"url\": \"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/supervised-fine-tuning#distilling-from-a-larger-model\",\n    \"statusCode\": 200,\n    \"contentType\": \"text/html\",\n    \"proxyUsed\": \"basic\",\n    \"cacheState\": \"hit\",\n    \"cachedAt\": \"2025-10-02T23:11:31.986Z\",\n    \"creditsUsed\": 1\n  }\n}"}]}

This system is also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.\\n\\n## [Available Compound Systems](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\\\#available-compound-systems)\\n\\nThere are two compound systems available:\\n\\n- [`groq/compound`](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/systems/compound): supports multiple tool calls per request.

The service is ideal for processing jobs that don't require immediate responses. You can also [explore the API reference directly here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch).\n\n## Overview\n\nWhile some uses of the OpenAI Platform require you to send synchronous requests, there are many cases where requests do not need an immediate response or [rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) prevent you from executing a large number of queries quickly. Batch processing jobs are often helpful in use cases like:\n\n1. Running evaluations\n2. Classifying large datasets\n3. Embedding content repositories\n\nThe Batch API offers a straightforward set of endpoints that allow you to collect a set of requests into a single file, kick off a batch processing job to execute these requests, query for the status of that batch while the underlying requests execute, and eventually retrieve the collected results when the batch is complete.\n\nCompared to using standard endpoints directly, Batch API has:\n\n1. **Better cost efficiency:** 50% cost discount compared to synchronous APIs\n2. **Higher rate limits:** [Substantially more headroom](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) compared to the synchronous APIs\n3. **Fast completion times:** Each batch completes within 24 hours (and often more quickly)\n\n## Getting started\n\n### 1\\. Prepare your batch file\n\nBatches start with a `.jsonl` file where each line contains the details of an individual request to the API. For now, the available endpoints are `/v1/responses` ( [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses)), `/v1/chat/completions` ( [Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)), `/v1/embeddings` ( [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)), and `/v1/completions` ( [Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)). For a given input file, the parameters in each line's `body` field are the same as the parameters for the underlying endpoint. Each request must include a unique `custom_id` value, which you can use to reference results after completion. Here's an example of an input file with 2 requests. Note that each input file can only include requests to a single model.\n\n```jsonl\n{\"custom_id\": \"request-1\", \"method\": \"POST\", \"url\": \"/v1/chat/completions\", \"body\": {\"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello world!\"}],\"max_tokens\": 1000}}\n{\"custom_id\": \"request-2\", \"method\": \"POST\", \"url\": \"/v1/chat/completions\", \"body\": {\"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an unhelpful assistant.\"},{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello world!\"}],\"max_tokens\": 1000}}\n```\n\n### 2\\. Upload your batch input file\n\nSimilar to our [Fine-tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization), you must first upload your input file so that you can reference it correctly when kicking off batches. Upload your `.jsonl` file using the [Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files).\n\nUpload files for Batch API\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nimport fs from \"fs\";\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst file = await openai.files.create({\n  file: fs.createReadStream(\"batchinput.jsonl\"),\n  purpose: \"batch\",\n});\n\nconsole.log(file);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nbatch_input_file = client.files.create(\n    file=open(\"batchinput.jsonl\", \"rb\"),\n    purpose=\"batch\"\n)\n\nprint(batch_input_file)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -F purpose=\"batch\" \\\n  -F file=\"@batchinput.jsonl\"\n```\n\n### 3\\. Create the batch\n\nOnce you've successfully uploaded your input file, you can use the input File object's ID to create a batch. In this case, let's assume the file ID is `file-abc123`. For now, the completion window can only be set to `24h`. You can also provide custom metadata via an optional `metadata` parameter.\n\nCreate the Batch\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst batch = await openai.batches.create({\n  input_file_id: \"file-abc123\",\n  endpoint: \"/v1/chat/completions\",\n  completion_window: \"24h\"\n});\n\nconsole.log(batch);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nbatch_input_file_id = batch_input_file.id\nclient.batches.create(\n    input_file_id=batch_input_file_id,\n    endpoint=\"/v1/chat/completions\",\n    completion_window=\"24h\",\n    metadata={\n        \"description\": \"nightly eval job\"\n    }\n)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"input_file_id\": \"file-abc123\",\n    \"endpoint\": \"/v1/chat/completions\",\n    \"completion_window\": \"24h\"\n  }'\n```\n\nThis request will return a [Batch object](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch/object) with metadata about your batch:\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n{\n  \"id\": \"batch_abc123\",\n  \"object\": \"batch\",\n  \"endpoint\": \"/v1/chat/completions\",\n  \"errors\": null,\n  \"input_file_id\": \"file-abc123\",\n  \"completion_window\": \"24h\",\n  \"status\": \"validating\",\n  \"output_file_id\": null,\n  \"error_file_id\": null,\n  \"created_at\": 1714508499,\n  \"in_progress_at\": null,\n  \"expires_at\": 1714536634,\n  \"completed_at\": null,\n  \"failed_at\": null,\n  \"expired_at\": null,\n  \"request_counts\": {\n    \"total\": 0,\n    \"completed\": 0,\n    \"failed\": 0\n  },\n  \"metadata\": null\n}\n```\n\n### 4\\. Check the status of a batch\n\nYou can check the status of a batch at any time, which will also return a Batch object.\n\nCheck the status of a batch\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst batch = await openai.batches.retrieve(\"batch_abc123\");\nconsole.log(batch);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nbatch = client.batches.retrieve(\"batch_abc123\")\nprint(batch)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches/batch_abc123 \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```\n\nThe status of a given Batch object can be any of the following:\n\n| Status | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `validating` | the input file is being validated before the batch can begin |\n| `failed` | the input file has failed the validation process |\n| `in_progress` | the input file was successfully validated and the batch is currently being run |\n| `finalizing` | the batch has completed and the results are being prepared |\n| `completed` | the batch has been completed and the results are ready |\n| `expired` | the batch was not able to be completed within the 24-hour time window |\n| `cancelling` | the batch is being cancelled (may take up to 10 minutes) |\n| `cancelled` | the batch was cancelled |\n\n### 5\\. Retrieve the results\n\nOnce the batch is complete, you can download the output by making a request against the [Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files) via the `output_file_id` field from the Batch object and writing it to a file on your machine, in this case `batch_output.jsonl`\n\nRetrieving the batch results\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst fileResponse = await openai.files.content(\"file-xyz123\");\nconst fileContents = await fileResponse.text();\n\nconsole.log(fileContents);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nfile_response = client.files.content(\"file-xyz123\")\nprint(file_response.text)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/files/file-xyz123/content \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" > batch_output.jsonl\n```\n\nThe output `.jsonl` file will have one response line for every successful request line in the input file. Any failed requests in the batch will have their error information written to an error file that can be found via the batch's `error_file_id`.\n\nNote that the output line order **may not match** the input line order. Instead of\nrelying on order to process your results, use the custom\\_id field which will be\npresent in each line of your output file and allow you to map requests in your input\nto results in your output.\n\n```jsonl\n{\"id\": \"batch_req_123\", \"custom_id\": \"request-2\", \"response\": {\"status_code\": 200, \"request_id\": \"req_123\", \"body\": {\"id\": \"chatcmpl-123\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"created\": 1711652795, \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\", \"choices\": [{\"index\": 0, \"message\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hello.\"}, \"logprobs\": null, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}], \"usage\": {\"prompt_tokens\": 22, \"completion_tokens\": 2, \"total_tokens\": 24}, \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_123\"}}, \"error\": null}\n{\"id\": \"batch_req_456\", \"custom_id\": \"request-1\", \"response\": {\"status_code\": 200, \"request_id\": \"req_789\", \"body\": {\"id\": \"chatcmpl-abc\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"created\": 1711652789, \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\", \"choices\": [{\"index\": 0, \"message\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\"}, \"logprobs\": null, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}], \"usage\": {\"prompt_tokens\": 20, \"completion_tokens\": 9, \"total_tokens\": 29}, \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_3ba\"}}, \"error\": null}\n```\n\nThe output file will automatically be deleted 30 days after the batch is complete.\n\n### 6\\. Cancel a batch\n\nIf necessary, you can cancel an ongoing batch. The batch's status will change to `cancelling` until in-flight requests are complete (up to 10 minutes), after which the status will change to `cancelled`.\n\nCancelling a batch\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst batch = await openai.batches.cancel(\"batch_abc123\");\nconsole.log(batch);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nclient.batches.cancel(\"batch_abc123\")\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches/batch_abc123/cancel \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -X POST\n```\n\n### 7\\. Get a list of all batches\n\nAt any time, you can see all your batches. For users with many batches, you can use the `limit` and `after` parameters to paginate your results.\n\nGetting a list of all batches\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst list = await openai.batches.list();\n\nfor await (const batch of list) {\n  console.log(batch);\n}\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nclient.batches.list(limit=10)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches?limit=10 \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```\n\n## Model availability\n\nThe Batch API is widely available across most of our models, but not all. Please refer to the [model reference docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to ensure the model you're using supports the Batch API.\n\n## Rate limits\n\nBatch API rate limits are separate from existing per-model rate limits. The Batch API has two new types of rate limits:\n\n1. **Per-batch limits:** A single batch may include up to 50,000 requests, and a batch input file can be up to 200 MB in size. Note that `/v1/embeddings` batches are also restricted to a maximum of 50,000 embedding inputs across all requests in the batch.\n2. **Enqueued prompt tokens per model:** Each model has a maximum number of enqueued prompt tokens allowed for batch processing. You can find these limits on the [Platform Settings page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).\n\nThere are no limits for output tokens or number of submitted requests for the Batch API today. Because Batch API rate limits are a new, separate pool, **using the Batch API will not consume tokens from your standard per-model rate limits**, thereby offering you a convenient way to increase the number of requests and processed tokens you can use when querying our API.\n\n## Batch expiration\n\nBatches that do not complete in time eventually move to an `expired` state; unfinished requests within that batch are cancelled, and any responses to completed requests are made available via the batch's output file. You will be charged for tokens consumed from any completed requests.\n\nExpired requests will be written to your error file with the message as shown below. You can use the `custom_id` to retrieve the request data for expired requests.\n\n```jsonl\n{\"id\": \"batch_req_123\", \"custom_id\": \"request-3\", \"response\": null, \"error\": {\"code\": \"batch_expired\", \"message\": \"This request could not be executed before the completion window expired.\"}}\n{\"id\": \"batch_req_123\", \"custom_id\": \"request-7\", \"response\": null, \"error\": {\"code\": \"batch_expired\", \"message\": \"This request could not be executed before the completion window expired.\"}}\n```\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":20186,"cache_read_input_tokens":41142,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":20186,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":14888,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTmDfptfbHY1CPZnpozTn","type":"assistant","uuid":"99267e54-2402-4873-aca1-6b936928ee68","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:35:25.617Z"}

The general flow of this technique is:\n\n- Tune a prompt for a larger model (like `gpt-4.1`) until you get great performance against your eval criteria.\n- Capture results generated from your model using whatever technique is convenient - note that the [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) stores model responses for 30 days by default.\n- Use the captured responses from the large model that fit your criteria to generate a dataset using the tools and techniques described above.\n- Tune a smaller model (like `gpt-4.1-mini`) using the dataset you created from the large model.\n\nThis technique can enable you to train a small model to perform similarly on a specific task to a larger, more costly model.\n\n## Upload training data\n\nUpload your dataset of examples to OpenAI. We use it to update the model's weights and produce outputs like the ones included in your data.\n\nIn addition to text completions, you can train the model to more effectively generate [structured JSON output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) or [function calls](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).\n\nUpload your data with button clicksCall the API to upload your data\n\nUpload your data with button clicks\n\n1. Navigate to the dashboard > **[fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/finetune)**.\n2. Click **\\+ Create**.\n3. Under **Training data**, upload your JSONL file.\n\nCall the API to upload your data\n\nAssuming the data above is saved to a file called `mydata.jsonl`, you can upload it to the OpenAI platform using the code below. Note that the `purpose` of the uploaded file is set to `fine-tune`:\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -F purpose=\"fine-tune\" \\\n  -F file=\"@mydata.jsonl\"\n```\n\nNote the `id` of the file that is uploaded in the data returned from the API - you'll need that file identifier in subsequent API requests.\n\n```json\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n{\n  \"object\": \"file\",\n  \"id\": \"file-RCnFCYRhFDcq1aHxiYkBHw\",\n  \"purpose\": \"fine-tune\",\n  \"filename\": \"mydata.jsonl\",\n  \"bytes\": 1058,\n  \"created_at\": 1746484901,\n  \"expires_at\": null,\n  \"status\": \"processed\",\n  \"status_details\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Create a fine-tuning job\n\nWith your test data uploaded, [create a fine-tuning job](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/create) to customize a base model using the training data you provide. When creating a fine-tuning job, you must specify:\n\n- A base model ( `model`) to use for fine-tuning. This can be either an OpenAI model ID or the ID of a previously fine-tuned model. See which models support fine-tuning in the [model docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).\n- A training file ( `training_file`) ID. This is the file you uploaded in the previous step.\n- A fine-tuning method ( `method`). This specifies which fine-tuning method you want to use to customize the model. Supervised fine-tuning is the default.\n\nUpload your data with button clicksCall the API to upload your data\n\nUpload your data with button clicks\n\n1. In the same **\\+ Create** modal as above, complete the required fields.\n2. Select supervised fine-tuning as the method and whichever model you want to train.\n3. When you're ready, click **Create** to start the job.\n\nCall the API to upload your data\n\nCreate a supervised fine-tuning job by calling the [fine-tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning):\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"training_file\": \"file-RCnFCYRhFDcq1aHxiYkBHw\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14\"\n  }'\n```\n\nThe API responds with information about the fine-tuning job in progress. Depending on the size of your training data, the training process may take several minutes or hours. You can [poll the API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/retrieve) for updates on a specific job.\n\nWhen the fine-tuning job finishes, your fine-tuned model is ready to use. A completed fine-tune job returns data like this:\n\n```json\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n{\n  \"object\": \"fine_tuning.job\",\n  \"id\": \"ftjob-uL1VKpwx7maorHNbOiDwFIn6\",\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14\",\n  \"created_at\": 1746484925,\n  \"finished_at\": 1746485841,\n  \"fine_tuned_model\": \"ft:gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14:openai::BTz2REMH\",\n  \"organization_id\": \"org-abc123\",\n  \"result_files\": [\\\n    \"file-9TLxKY2A8tC5YE1RULYxf6\"\\\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"succeeded\",\n  \"validation_file\": null,\n  \"training_file\": \"file-RCnFCYRhFDcq1aHxiYkBHw\",\n  \"hyperparameters\": {\n    \"n_epochs\": 10,\n    \"batch_size\": 1,\n    \"learning_rate_multiplier\": 1\n  },\n  \"trained_tokens\": 1700,\n  \"error\": {},\n  \"user_provided_suffix\": null,\n  \"seed\": 1935755117,\n  \"estimated_finish\": null,\n  \"integrations\": [],\n  \"metadata\": null,\n  \"usage_metrics\": null,\n  \"shared_with_openai\": false,\n  \"method\": {\n    \"type\": \"supervised\",\n    \"supervised\": {\n      \"hyperparameters\": {\n        \"n_epochs\": 10,\n        \"batch_size\": 1,\n        \"learning_rate_multiplier\": 1.0\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote the `fine_tuned_model` property. This is the model ID to use in [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) or [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) to make API requests using your fine-tuned model.\n\nHere's an example of calling the Responses API with your fine-tuned model ID:\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"ft:gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14:openai::BTz2REMH\",\n    \"input\": \"What is the weather like in Boston today?\",\n    \"tools\": [\\\n      {\\\n        \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\\\n        \"description\": \"Get the current weather\",\\\n        \"parameters\": {\\\n          \"type\": \"object\",\\\n          \"properties\": {\\\n            \"location\": {\\\n                \"type\": \"string\",\\\n                \"description\": \"The city and country, eg.

Adjust your prompts, data, and fine-tuning job as needed until you get the results you want. The best way to fine-tune is to continue iterating.\n\n### Compare to evals\n\nTo see if your fine-tuned model performs better than the original base model, [use evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals). Before running your fine-tuning job, carve out data from the same training dataset you collected in step 1. This holdout data acts as a control group when you use it for evals. Make sure the training and holdout data have roughly the same diversity of user input types and model responses.\n\n[Learn more about running evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals).\n\n### Monitor the status\n\nCheck the status of a fine-tuning job in the dashboard or by polling the job ID in the API.\n\nMonitor in the UIMonitor with API calls\n\nMonitor in the UI\n\n1. Navigate to the [fine-tuning dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune).\n2. Select the job you want to monitor.\n3. Review the status, checkpoints, message, and metrics.\n\nMonitor with API calls\n\nUse this curl command to get information about your fine-tuning job:\n\n```bash\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs/ftjob-uL1VKpwx7maorHNbOiDwFIn6 \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\"\n```\n\nThe job contains a `fine_tuned_model` property, which is your new fine-tuned model's unique ID.\n\n```json\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n{\n  \"object\": \"fine_tuning.job\",\n  \"id\": \"ftjob-uL1VKpwx7maorHNbOiDwFIn6\",\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14\",\n  \"created_at\": 1746484925,\n  \"finished_at\": 1746485841,\n  \"fine_tuned_model\": \"ft:gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14:openai::BTz2REMH\",\n  \"organization_id\": \"org-abc123\",\n  \"result_files\": [\\\n    \"file-9TLxKY2A8tC5YE1RULYxf6\"\\\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"succeeded\",\n  \"validation_file\": null,\n  \"training_file\": \"file-RCnFCYRhFDcq1aHxiYkBHw\",\n  \"hyperparameters\": {\n    \"n_epochs\": 10,\n    \"batch_size\": 1,\n    \"learning_rate_multiplier\": 1\n  },\n  \"trained_tokens\": 1700,\n  \"error\": {},\n  \"user_provided_suffix\": null,\n  \"seed\": 1935755117,\n  \"estimated_finish\": null,\n  \"integrations\": [],\n  \"metadata\": null,\n  \"usage_metrics\": null,\n  \"shared_with_openai\": false,\n  \"method\": {\n    \"type\": \"supervised\",\n    \"supervised\": {\n      \"hyperparameters\": {\n        \"n_epochs\": 10,\n        \"batch_size\": 1,\n        \"learning_rate_multiplier\": 1.0\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Try using your fine-tuned model\n\nEvaluate your newly optimized model by using it! When the fine-tuned model finishes training, use its ID in either the [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) or [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) API, just as you would an OpenAI base model.\n\nUse your model in the PlaygroundUse your model with an API call\n\nUse your model in the Playground\n\n1. Navigate to your fine-tuning job in [the dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune).\n2. In the right pane, navigate to **Output model** and copy the model ID. It should start with `ft:…`\n3. Open the [Playground](https://platform.openai.com/playground).\n4. In the **Model** dropdown menu, paste the model ID. Here, you should also see other fine-tuned models you've created.\n5. Run some prompts and see how your fine-tuned performs!\n\nUse your model with an API call\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"ft:gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14:openai::BTz2REMH\",\n    \"input\": \"What is 4+4?\"\n  }'\n```\n\n### Use checkpoints if needed\n\nCheckpoints are models you can use. We create a full model checkpoint for you at the end of each training epoch. They're useful in cases where your fine-tuned model improves early on but then memorizes the dataset instead of learning generalizable knowledge—called \\_overfitting. Checkpoints provide versions of your customized model from various moments in the process.\n\nFind checkpoints in the dashboardQuery the API for checkpoints\n\nFind checkpoints in the dashboard\n\n1. Navigate to the [fine-tuning dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune).\n2. In the left panel, select the job you want to investigate. Wait until it succeeds.\n3. In the right panel, scroll to the list of checkpoints.\n4. Hover over any checkpoint to see a link to launch in the Playground.\n5. Test the checkpoint model's behavior by prompting it in the Playground.\n\nQuery the API for checkpoints\n\n1. Wait until a job succeeds, which you can verify by [querying the status of a job](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/retrieve).\n2. [Query the checkpoints endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list-checkpoints) with your fine-tuning job ID to access a list of model checkpoints for the fine-tuning job.\n3. Find the `fine_tuned_model_checkpoint` field for the name of the model checkpoint.\n4. Use this model just like you would the final fine-tuned model.\n\nThe checkpoint object contains `metrics` data to help you determine the usefulness of this model. As an example, the response looks like this:\n\n```json\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n{\n  \"object\": \"fine_tuning.job.checkpoint\",\n  \"id\": \"ftckpt_zc4Q7MP6XxulcVzj4MZdwsAB\",\n  \"created_at\": 1519129973,\n  \"fine_tuned_model_checkpoint\": \"ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:my-org:custom-suffix:96olL566:ckpt-step-2000\",\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"full_valid_loss\": 0.134,\n    \"full_valid_mean_token_accuracy\": 0.874\n  },\n  \"fine_tuning_job_id\": \"ftjob-abc123\",\n  \"step_number\": 2000\n}\n```\n\nEach checkpoint specifies:\n\n- `step_number`: The step at which the checkpoint was created (where each epoch is number of steps in the training set divided by the batch size)\n- `metrics`: An object containing the metrics for your fine-tuning job at the step when the checkpoint was created\n\nCurrently, only the checkpoints for the last three epochs of the job are saved and available for use.\n\n## Safety checks\n\nBefore launching in production, review and follow the following safety information.\n\nHow we assess for safety\n\nOnce a fine-tuning job is completed, we assess the resulting model's behavior across 13 distinct safety categories. Each category represents a critical area where AI outputs could potentially cause harm if not properly controlled.\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| advice | Advice or guidance that violates our policies. |\n| harassment/threatening | Harassment content that also includes violence or serious harm towards any target. |\n| hate | Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. Hateful content aimed at non-protected groups (e.g., chess players) is harassment. |\n| hate/threatening | Hateful content that also includes violence or serious harm towards the targeted group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. |\n| highly-sensitive | Highly sensitive data that violates our policies. |\n| illicit | Content that gives advice or instruction on how to commit illicit acts. A phrase like \"how to shoplift\" would fit this category. |\n| propaganda | Praise or assistance for ideology that violates our policies. |\n| self-harm/instructions | Content that encourages performing acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders, or that gives instructions or advice on how to commit such acts. |\n| self-harm/intent | Content where the speaker expresses that they are engaging or intend to engage in acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders. |\n| sensitive | Sensitive data that violates our policies. |\n| sexual/minors | Sexual content that includes an individual who is under 18 years old. |\n| sexual | Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness). |\n| violence | Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury. |\n\nEach category has a predefined pass threshold; if too many evaluated examples in a given category fail, OpenAI blocks the fine-tuned model from deployment. If your fine-tuned model does not pass the safety checks, OpenAI sends a message in the fine-tuning job explaining which categories don't meet the required thresholds. You can view the results in the moderation checks section of the fine-tuning job.\n\nHow to pass safety checks\n\nIn addition to reviewing any failed safety checks in the fine-tuning job object, you can retrieve details about which categories failed by querying the [fine-tuning API events endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list-events). Look for events of type `moderation_checks` for details about category results and enforcement. This information can help you narrow down which categories to target for retraining and improvement. The [model spec](https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#overview) has rules and examples that can help identify areas for additional training data.\n\nWhile these evaluations cover a broad range of safety categories, conduct your own evaluations of the fine-tuned model to ensure it's appropriate for your use case.\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that you know the basics of supervised fine-tuning, explore these other methods as well.\n\n[Vision fine-tuning\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn to fine-tune for computer vision with image inputs.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision-fine-tuning) [Direct preference optimization\\\\\n\\\\\nFine-tune a model using direct preference optimization (DPO).](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/direct-preference-optimization) [Reinforcement fine-tuning\\\\\n\\\\\nFine-tune a reasoning model by grading its outputs.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reinforcement-fine-tuning)\n"}}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":8,"cache_creation_input_tokens":20186,"cache_read_input_tokens":41142,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":20186,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":14888,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CTmDfptfbHY1CPZnpozTn","type":"assistant","uuid":"f948c98e-2519-445b-b530-75bf716d2264","timestamp":"2025-10-04T00:37:45.424Z"}

This system is great for use cases that require a single web search or code execution per request. `groq/compound-mini` has an average of 3x lower latency than `groq/compound`.\n\nBoth systems support the following tools:\n\n- [Web Search](https://console.groq.com/docs/web-search)\n- [Visit Website](https://console.groq.com/docs/visit-website)\n- [Code Execution](https://console.groq.com/docs/code-execution)\n- [Browser Automation](https://console.groq.com/docs/browser-automation)\n- [Wolfram Alpha](https://console.groq.com/docs/wolfram-alpha)\n\nCustom [user-provided tools](https://console.groq.com/docs/tool-use) are not supported at this time.\n\n## [Quickstart](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#quickstart)\n\nTo use compound systems, change the `model` parameter to either `groq/compound` or `groq/compound-mini`:\n\nPython\n\n```\n1from groq import Groq\n2\n3client = Groq()\n4\n5completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n6    messages=[\\\n7        {\\\n8            \"role\": \"user\",\\\n9            \"content\": \"What is the current weather in Tokyo?\",\\\n10        }\\\n11    ],\n12    # Change model to compound to use built-in tools\n13    # model: \"llama-3.3-70b-versatile\",\n14    model=\"groq/compound\",\n15)\n16\n17print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n18# Print all tool calls\n19# print(completion.choices[0].message.executed_tools)\n```\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nWhen the API is called, it will intelligently decide when to use search or code execution to best answer the user's query.\nThese tool calls are performed on the server side, so no additional setup is required on your part to use built-in tools.\n\nIn the above example, the API will use its build in web search tool to find the current weather in Tokyo.\nIf you didn't use compound systems, you might have needed to add your own custom tools to make API requests to a weather service, then perform multiple API calls to Groq to get a final result.\nInstead, with compound systems, you can get a final result with a single API call.\n\n## [Executed Tools](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#executed-tools)\n\nTo view the tools (search or code execution) used automatically by the compound system, check the `executed_tools` field in the response:\n\nPython\n\n```\n1import os\n2from groq import Groq\n3\n4client = Groq(api_key=os.environ.get(\"GROQ_API_KEY\"))\n5\n6response = client.chat.completions.create(\n7    model=\"groq/compound\",\n8    messages=[\\\n9        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What did Groq release last week?\"}\\\n10    ]\n11)\n12# Log the tools that were used to generate the response\n13print(response.choices[0].message.executed_tools)\n```\n\n## [Model Usage Details](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#model-usage-details)\n\nThe `usage_breakdown` field in responses provides detailed information about all the underlying models used during the compound system's execution.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n\"usage_breakdown\": {\n  \"models\": [\\\n    {\\\n      \"model\": \"llama-3.3-70b-versatile\",\\\n      \"usage\": {\\\n        \"queue_time\": 0.017298032,\\\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 226,\\\n        \"prompt_time\": 0.023959775,\\\n        \"completion_tokens\": 16,\\\n        \"completion_time\": 0.061639794,\\\n        \"total_tokens\": 242,\\\n        \"total_time\": 0.085599569\\\n      }\\\n    },\\\n    {\\\n      \"model\": \"openai/gpt-oss-120b\",\\\n      \"usage\": {\\\n        \"queue_time\": 0.019125835,\\\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 903,\\\n        \"prompt_time\": 0.033082052,\\\n        \"completion_tokens\": 873,\\\n        \"completion_time\": 1.776467372,\\\n        \"total_tokens\": 1776,\\\n        \"total_time\": 1.809549424\\\n      }\\\n    }\\\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## [System Versioning](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#system-versioning)\n\nCompound systems support versioning through the `Groq-Model-Version` header. In most cases, you won't need to change anything since you'll automatically be on the latest stable version.

The service is ideal for processing jobs that don't require immediate responses. You can also [explore the API reference directly here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch).\n\n## Overview\n\nWhile some uses of the OpenAI Platform require you to send synchronous requests, there are many cases where requests do not need an immediate response or [rate limits](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits) prevent you from executing a large number of queries quickly. Batch processing jobs are often helpful in use cases like:\n\n1. Running evaluations\n2. Classifying large datasets\n3. Embedding content repositories\n\nThe Batch API offers a straightforward set of endpoints that allow you to collect a set of requests into a single file, kick off a batch processing job to execute these requests, query for the status of that batch while the underlying requests execute, and eventually retrieve the collected results when the batch is complete.\n\nCompared to using standard endpoints directly, Batch API has:\n\n1. **Better cost efficiency:** 50% cost discount compared to synchronous APIs\n2. **Higher rate limits:** [Substantially more headroom](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) compared to the synchronous APIs\n3. **Fast completion times:** Each batch completes within 24 hours (and often more quickly)\n\n## Getting started\n\n### 1\\. Prepare your batch file\n\nBatches start with a `.jsonl` file where each line contains the details of an individual request to the API. For now, the available endpoints are `/v1/responses` ( [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses)), `/v1/chat/completions` ( [Chat Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat)), `/v1/embeddings` ( [Embeddings API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/embeddings)), and `/v1/completions` ( [Completions API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions)). For a given input file, the parameters in each line's `body` field are the same as the parameters for the underlying endpoint. Each request must include a unique `custom_id` value, which you can use to reference results after completion. Here's an example of an input file with 2 requests. Note that each input file can only include requests to a single model.\n\n```jsonl\n{\"custom_id\": \"request-1\", \"method\": \"POST\", \"url\": \"/v1/chat/completions\", \"body\": {\"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are a helpful assistant.\"},{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello world!\"}],\"max_tokens\": 1000}}\n{\"custom_id\": \"request-2\", \"method\": \"POST\", \"url\": \"/v1/chat/completions\", \"body\": {\"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\", \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an unhelpful assistant.\"},{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"Hello world!\"}],\"max_tokens\": 1000}}\n```\n\n### 2\\. Upload your batch input file\n\nSimilar to our [Fine-tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/model-optimization), you must first upload your input file so that you can reference it correctly when kicking off batches. Upload your `.jsonl` file using the [Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files).\n\nUpload files for Batch API\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nimport fs from \"fs\";\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst file = await openai.files.create({\n  file: fs.createReadStream(\"batchinput.jsonl\"),\n  purpose: \"batch\",\n});\n\nconsole.log(file);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nbatch_input_file = client.files.create(\n    file=open(\"batchinput.jsonl\", \"rb\"),\n    purpose=\"batch\"\n)\n\nprint(batch_input_file)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -F purpose=\"batch\" \\\n  -F file=\"@batchinput.jsonl\"\n```\n\n### 3\\. Create the batch\n\nOnce you've successfully uploaded your input file, you can use the input File object's ID to create a batch. In this case, let's assume the file ID is `file-abc123`. For now, the completion window can only be set to `24h`. You can also provide custom metadata via an optional `metadata` parameter.\n\nCreate the Batch\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst batch = await openai.batches.create({\n  input_file_id: \"file-abc123\",\n  endpoint: \"/v1/chat/completions\",\n  completion_window: \"24h\"\n});\n\nconsole.log(batch);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nbatch_input_file_id = batch_input_file.id\nclient.batches.create(\n    input_file_id=batch_input_file_id,\n    endpoint=\"/v1/chat/completions\",\n    completion_window=\"24h\",\n    metadata={\n        \"description\": \"nightly eval job\"\n    }\n)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"input_file_id\": \"file-abc123\",\n    \"endpoint\": \"/v1/chat/completions\",\n    \"completion_window\": \"24h\"\n  }'\n```\n\nThis request will return a [Batch object](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/batch/object) with metadata about your batch:\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n{\n  \"id\": \"batch_abc123\",\n  \"object\": \"batch\",\n  \"endpoint\": \"/v1/chat/completions\",\n  \"errors\": null,\n  \"input_file_id\": \"file-abc123\",\n  \"completion_window\": \"24h\",\n  \"status\": \"validating\",\n  \"output_file_id\": null,\n  \"error_file_id\": null,\n  \"created_at\": 1714508499,\n  \"in_progress_at\": null,\n  \"expires_at\": 1714536634,\n  \"completed_at\": null,\n  \"failed_at\": null,\n  \"expired_at\": null,\n  \"request_counts\": {\n    \"total\": 0,\n    \"completed\": 0,\n    \"failed\": 0\n  },\n  \"metadata\": null\n}\n```\n\n### 4\\. Check the status of a batch\n\nYou can check the status of a batch at any time, which will also return a Batch object.\n\nCheck the status of a batch\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst batch = await openai.batches.retrieve(\"batch_abc123\");\nconsole.log(batch);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nbatch = client.batches.retrieve(\"batch_abc123\")\nprint(batch)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches/batch_abc123 \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```\n\nThe status of a given Batch object can be any of the following:\n\n| Status | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| `validating` | the input file is being validated before the batch can begin |\n| `failed` | the input file has failed the validation process |\n| `in_progress` | the input file was successfully validated and the batch is currently being run |\n| `finalizing` | the batch has completed and the results are being prepared |\n| `completed` | the batch has been completed and the results are ready |\n| `expired` | the batch was not able to be completed within the 24-hour time window |\n| `cancelling` | the batch is being cancelled (may take up to 10 minutes) |\n| `cancelled` | the batch was cancelled |\n\n### 5\\. Retrieve the results\n\nOnce the batch is complete, you can download the output by making a request against the [Files API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/files) via the `output_file_id` field from the Batch object and writing it to a file on your machine, in this case `batch_output.jsonl`\n\nRetrieving the batch results\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst fileResponse = await openai.files.content(\"file-xyz123\");\nconst fileContents = await fileResponse.text();\n\nconsole.log(fileContents);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nfile_response = client.files.content(\"file-xyz123\")\nprint(file_response.text)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/files/file-xyz123/content \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" > batch_output.jsonl\n```\n\nThe output `.jsonl` file will have one response line for every successful request line in the input file. Any failed requests in the batch will have their error information written to an error file that can be found via the batch's `error_file_id`.\n\nNote that the output line order **may not match** the input line order. Instead of\nrelying on order to process your results, use the custom\\_id field which will be\npresent in each line of your output file and allow you to map requests in your input\nto results in your output.\n\n```jsonl\n{\"id\": \"batch_req_123\", \"custom_id\": \"request-2\", \"response\": {\"status_code\": 200, \"request_id\": \"req_123\", \"body\": {\"id\": \"chatcmpl-123\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"created\": 1711652795, \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\", \"choices\": [{\"index\": 0, \"message\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hello.\"}, \"logprobs\": null, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}], \"usage\": {\"prompt_tokens\": 22, \"completion_tokens\": 2, \"total_tokens\": 24}, \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_123\"}}, \"error\": null}\n{\"id\": \"batch_req_456\", \"custom_id\": \"request-1\", \"response\": {\"status_code\": 200, \"request_id\": \"req_789\", \"body\": {\"id\": \"chatcmpl-abc\", \"object\": \"chat.completion\", \"created\": 1711652789, \"model\": \"gpt-3.5-turbo-0125\", \"choices\": [{\"index\": 0, \"message\": {\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"Hello! How can I assist you today?\"}, \"logprobs\": null, \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"}], \"usage\": {\"prompt_tokens\": 20, \"completion_tokens\": 9, \"total_tokens\": 29}, \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_3ba\"}}, \"error\": null}\n```\n\nThe output file will automatically be deleted 30 days after the batch is complete.\n\n### 6\\. Cancel a batch\n\nIf necessary, you can cancel an ongoing batch. The batch's status will change to `cancelling` until in-flight requests are complete (up to 10 minutes), after which the status will change to `cancelled`.\n\nCancelling a batch\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst batch = await openai.batches.cancel(\"batch_abc123\");\nconsole.log(batch);\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nclient.batches.cancel(\"batch_abc123\")\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches/batch_abc123/cancel \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -X POST\n```\n\n### 7\\. Get a list of all batches\n\nAt any time, you can see all your batches. For users with many batches, you can use the `limit` and `after` parameters to paginate your results.\n\nGetting a list of all batches\n\njavascript\n\n```javascript\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\nimport OpenAI from \"openai\";\nconst openai = new OpenAI();\n\nconst list = await openai.batches.list();\n\nfor await (const batch of list) {\n  console.log(batch);\n}\n```\n\n```python\n1\n2\n3\n4\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nclient = OpenAI()\n\nclient.batches.list(limit=10)\n```\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/batches?limit=10 \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\"\n```\n\n## Model availability\n\nThe Batch API is widely available across most of our models, but not all. Please refer to the [model reference docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models) to ensure the model you're using supports the Batch API.\n\n## Rate limits\n\nBatch API rate limits are separate from existing per-model rate limits. The Batch API has two new types of rate limits:\n\n1. **Per-batch limits:** A single batch may include up to 50,000 requests, and a batch input file can be up to 200 MB in size. Note that `/v1/embeddings` batches are also restricted to a maximum of 50,000 embedding inputs across all requests in the batch.\n2. **Enqueued prompt tokens per model:** Each model has a maximum number of enqueued prompt tokens allowed for batch processing. You can find these limits on the [Platform Settings page](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits).\n\nThere are no limits for output tokens or number of submitted requests for the Batch API today. Because Batch API rate limits are a new, separate pool, **using the Batch API will not consume tokens from your standard per-model rate limits**, thereby offering you a convenient way to increase the number of requests and processed tokens you can use when querying our API.\n\n## Batch expiration\n\nBatches that do not complete in time eventually move to an `expired` state; unfinished requests within that batch are cancelled, and any responses to completed requests are made available via the batch's output file. You will be charged for tokens consumed from any completed requests.\n\nExpired requests will be written to your error file with the message as shown below.

The result is a customized model that more reliably produces your desired style and content.\n\n| How it works | Best for | Use with |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Provide examples of correct responses to prompts to guide the model's behavior.<br>Often uses human-generated \"ground truth\" responses to show the model how it should respond. | - Classification<br>- Nuanced translation<br>- Generating content in a specific format<br>- Correcting instruction-following failures | `gpt-4.1-2025-04-14` `gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-14` `gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14` |\n\n## Overview\n\nSupervised fine-tuning has four major parts:\n\n1. Build your training dataset to determine what \"good\" looks like\n2. Upload a training dataset containing example prompts and desired model output\n3. Create a fine-tuning job for a base model using your training data\n4. Evaluate your results using the fine-tuned model\n\n**Good evals first!** Only invest in fine-tuning after setting up evals. You need a\nreliable way to determine whether your fine-tuned model is performing better than a\nbase model.\n\n[Set up evals →](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals)\n\n## Build your dataset\n\nBuild a robust, representative dataset to get useful results from a fine-tuned model. Use the following techniques and considerations.\n\n### Right number of examples\n\n- The minimum number of examples you can provide for fine-tuning is 10\n- We see improvements from fine-tuning on 50–100 examples, but the right number for you varies greatly and depends on the use case\n- We recommend starting with 50 well-crafted demonstrations and [evaluating the results](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals)\n\nIf performance improves with 50 good examples, try adding examples to see further results. If 50 examples have no impact, rethink your task or prompt before adding training data.\n\n### What makes a good example\n\n- Whatever prompts and outputs you expect in your application, as realistic as possible\n- Specific, clear questions and answers\n- Use historical data, expert data, logged data, or [other types of collected data](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals)\n\n### Formatting your data\n\n- Use [JSONL format](https://jsonlines.org/), with one complete JSON structure on every line of the training data file\n- Use the [chat completions format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input)\n- Your file must have at least 10 lines\n\nJSONL format example fileCorresponding JSON data\n\nJSONL format example file\n\nAn example of JSONL training data, where the model calls a `get_weather` function:\n\n```text\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n{\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\"What is the weather in San Francisco?\"},{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"tool_calls\":[{\"id\":\"call_id\",\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"get_current_weather\",\"arguments\":\"{\\\"location\\\": \\\"San Francisco, USA\\\", \\\"format\\\": \\\"celsius\\\"}\"}}]}],\"parallel_tool_calls\":false,\"tools\":[{\"type\":\"function\",\"function\":{\"name\":\"get_current_weather\",\"description\":\"Get the current weather\",\"parameters\":{\"type\":\"object\",\"properties\":{\"location\":{\"type\":\"string\",\"description\":\"The city and country, eg.

The general flow of this technique is:\n\n- Tune a prompt for a larger model (like `gpt-4.1`) until you get great performance against your eval criteria.\n- Capture results generated from your model using whatever technique is convenient - note that the [Responses API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) stores model responses for 30 days by default.\n- Use the captured responses from the large model that fit your criteria to generate a dataset using the tools and techniques described above.\n- Tune a smaller model (like `gpt-4.1-mini`) using the dataset you created from the large model.\n\nThis technique can enable you to train a small model to perform similarly on a specific task to a larger, more costly model.\n\n## Upload training data\n\nUpload your dataset of examples to OpenAI. We use it to update the model's weights and produce outputs like the ones included in your data.\n\nIn addition to text completions, you can train the model to more effectively generate [structured JSON output](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/structured-outputs) or [function calls](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).\n\nUpload your data with button clicksCall the API to upload your data\n\nUpload your data with button clicks\n\n1. Navigate to the dashboard > **[fine-tuning](https://platform.openai.com/finetune)**.\n2. Click **\\+ Create**.\n3. Under **Training data**, upload your JSONL file.\n\nCall the API to upload your data\n\nAssuming the data above is saved to a file called `mydata.jsonl`, you can upload it to the OpenAI platform using the code below. Note that the `purpose` of the uploaded file is set to `fine-tune`:\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/files \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -F purpose=\"fine-tune\" \\\n  -F file=\"@mydata.jsonl\"\n```\n\nNote the `id` of the file that is uploaded in the data returned from the API - you'll need that file identifier in subsequent API requests.\n\n```json\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n{\n  \"object\": \"file\",\n  \"id\": \"file-RCnFCYRhFDcq1aHxiYkBHw\",\n  \"purpose\": \"fine-tune\",\n  \"filename\": \"mydata.jsonl\",\n  \"bytes\": 1058,\n  \"created_at\": 1746484901,\n  \"expires_at\": null,\n  \"status\": \"processed\",\n  \"status_details\": null\n}\n```\n\n## Create a fine-tuning job\n\nWith your test data uploaded, [create a fine-tuning job](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/create) to customize a base model using the training data you provide. When creating a fine-tuning job, you must specify:\n\n- A base model ( `model`) to use for fine-tuning. This can be either an OpenAI model ID or the ID of a previously fine-tuned model. See which models support fine-tuning in the [model docs](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models).\n- A training file ( `training_file`) ID. This is the file you uploaded in the previous step.\n- A fine-tuning method ( `method`). This specifies which fine-tuning method you want to use to customize the model. Supervised fine-tuning is the default.\n\nUpload your data with button clicksCall the API to upload your data\n\nUpload your data with button clicks\n\n1. In the same **\\+ Create** modal as above, complete the required fields.\n2. Select supervised fine-tuning as the method and whichever model you want to train.\n3. When you're ready, click **Create** to start the job.\n\nCall the API to upload your data\n\nCreate a supervised fine-tuning job by calling the [fine-tuning API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning):\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/fine_tuning/jobs \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"training_file\": \"file-RCnFCYRhFDcq1aHxiYkBHw\",\n    \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14\"\n  }'\n```\n\nThe API responds with information about the fine-tuning job in progress. Depending on the size of your training data, the training process may take several minutes or hours. You can [poll the API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/retrieve) for updates on a specific job.\n\nWhen the fine-tuning job finishes, your fine-tuned model is ready to use. A completed fine-tune job returns data like this:\n\n```json\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n{\n  \"object\": \"fine_tuning.job\",\n  \"id\": \"ftjob-uL1VKpwx7maorHNbOiDwFIn6\",\n  \"model\": \"gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14\",\n  \"created_at\": 1746484925,\n  \"finished_at\": 1746485841,\n  \"fine_tuned_model\": \"ft:gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14:openai::BTz2REMH\",\n  \"organization_id\": \"org-abc123\",\n  \"result_files\": [\\\n    \"file-9TLxKY2A8tC5YE1RULYxf6\"\\\n  ],\n  \"status\": \"succeeded\",\n  \"validation_file\": null,\n  \"training_file\": \"file-RCnFCYRhFDcq1aHxiYkBHw\",\n  \"hyperparameters\": {\n    \"n_epochs\": 10,\n    \"batch_size\": 1,\n    \"learning_rate_multiplier\": 1\n  },\n  \"trained_tokens\": 1700,\n  \"error\": {},\n  \"user_provided_suffix\": null,\n  \"seed\": 1935755117,\n  \"estimated_finish\": null,\n  \"integrations\": [],\n  \"metadata\": null,\n  \"usage_metrics\": null,\n  \"shared_with_openai\": false,\n  \"method\": {\n    \"type\": \"supervised\",\n    \"supervised\": {\n      \"hyperparameters\": {\n        \"n_epochs\": 10,\n        \"batch_size\": 1,\n        \"learning_rate_multiplier\": 1.0\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote the `fine_tuned_model` property. This is the model ID to use in [Responses](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/responses) or [Chat Completions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat) to make API requests using your fine-tuned model.\n\nHere's an example of calling the Responses API with your fine-tuned model ID:\n\n```bash\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\ncurl https://api.openai.com/v1/responses \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"ft:gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14:openai::BTz2REMH\",\n    \"input\": \"What is the weather like in Boston today?\",\n    \"tools\": [\\\n      {\\\n        \"name\": \"get_current_weather\",\\\n        \"description\": \"Get the current weather\",\\\n        \"parameters\": {\\\n          \"type\": \"object\",\\\n          \"properties\": {\\\n            \"location\": {\\\n                \"type\": \"string\",\\\n                \"description\": \"The city and country, eg.

Adjust your prompts, data, and fine-tuning job as needed until you get the results you want. The best way to fine-tune is to continue iterating.\n\n### Compare to evals\n\nTo see if your fine-tuned model performs better than the original base model, [use evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals). Before running your fine-tuning job, carve out data from the same training dataset you collected in step 1. This holdout data acts as a control group when you use it for evals. Make sure the training and holdout data have roughly the same diversity of user input types and model responses.\n\n[Learn more about running evals](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/evals).\n\n### Monitor the status\n\nCheck the status of a fine-tuning job in the dashboard or by polling the job ID in the API.\n\nMonitor in the UIMonitor with API calls\n\nMonitor in the UI\n\n1. Navigate to the [fine-tuning dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/finetune).\n2. Select the job you want to monitor.\n3.

Wait until a job succeeds, which you can verify by [querying the status of a job](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/retrieve).\n2. [Query the checkpoints endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list-checkpoints) with your fine-tuning job ID to access a list of model checkpoints for the fine-tuning job.\n3. Find the `fine_tuned_model_checkpoint` field for the name of the model checkpoint.\n4. Use this model just like you would the final fine-tuned model.\n\nThe checkpoint object contains `metrics` data to help you determine the usefulness of this model. As an example, the response looks like this:\n\n```json\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n{\n  \"object\": \"fine_tuning.job.checkpoint\",\n  \"id\": \"ftckpt_zc4Q7MP6XxulcVzj4MZdwsAB\",\n  \"created_at\": 1519129973,\n  \"fine_tuned_model_checkpoint\": \"ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0125:my-org:custom-suffix:96olL566:ckpt-step-2000\",\n  \"metrics\": {\n    \"full_valid_loss\": 0.134,\n    \"full_valid_mean_token_accuracy\": 0.874\n  },\n  \"fine_tuning_job_id\": \"ftjob-abc123\",\n  \"step_number\": 2000\n}\n```\n\nEach checkpoint specifies:\n\n- `step_number`: The step at which the checkpoint was created (where each epoch is number of steps in the training set divided by the batch size)\n- `metrics`: An object containing the metrics for your fine-tuning job at the step when the checkpoint was created\n\nCurrently, only the checkpoints for the last three epochs of the job are saved and available for use.\n\n## Safety checks\n\nBefore launching in production, review and follow the following safety information.\n\nHow we assess for safety\n\nOnce a fine-tuning job is completed, we assess the resulting model's behavior across 13 distinct safety categories. Each category represents a critical area where AI outputs could potentially cause harm if not properly controlled.\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| advice | Advice or guidance that violates our policies. |\n| harassment/threatening | Harassment content that also includes violence or serious harm towards any target. |\n| hate | Content that expresses, incites, or promotes hate based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. Hateful content aimed at non-protected groups (e.g., chess players) is harassment. |\n| hate/threatening | Hateful content that also includes violence or serious harm towards the targeted group based on race, gender, ethnicity, religion, nationality, sexual orientation, disability status, or caste. |\n| highly-sensitive | Highly sensitive data that violates our policies. |\n| illicit | Content that gives advice or instruction on how to commit illicit acts. A phrase like \"how to shoplift\" would fit this category. |\n| propaganda | Praise or assistance for ideology that violates our policies. |\n| self-harm/instructions | Content that encourages performing acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders, or that gives instructions or advice on how to commit such acts. |\n| self-harm/intent | Content where the speaker expresses that they are engaging or intend to engage in acts of self-harm, such as suicide, cutting, and eating disorders. |\n| sensitive | Sensitive data that violates our policies. |\n| sexual/minors | Sexual content that includes an individual who is under 18 years old. |\n| sexual | Content meant to arouse sexual excitement, such as the description of sexual activity, or that promotes sexual services (excluding sex education and wellness). |\n| violence | Content that depicts death, violence, or physical injury. |\n\nEach category has a predefined pass threshold; if too many evaluated examples in a given category fail, OpenAI blocks the fine-tuned model from deployment. If your fine-tuned model does not pass the safety checks, OpenAI sends a message in the fine-tuning job explaining which categories don't meet the required thresholds. You can view the results in the moderation checks section of the fine-tuning job.\n\nHow to pass safety checks\n\nIn addition to reviewing any failed safety checks in the fine-tuning job object, you can retrieve details about which categories failed by querying the [fine-tuning API events endpoint](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/list-events). Look for events of type `moderation_checks` for details about category results and enforcement. This information can help you narrow down which categories to target for retraining and improvement. The [model spec](https://cdn.openai.com/spec/model-spec-2024-05-08.html#overview) has rules and examples that can help identify areas for additional training data.\n\nWhile these evaluations cover a broad range of safety categories, conduct your own evaluations of the fine-tuned model to ensure it's appropriate for your use case.\n\n## Next steps\n\nNow that you know the basics of supervised fine-tuning, explore these other methods as well.\n\n[Vision fine-tuning\\\\\n\\\\\nLearn to fine-tune for computer vision with image inputs.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/vision-fine-tuning) [Direct preference optimization\\\\\n\\\\\nFine-tune a model using direct preference optimization (DPO).](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/direct-preference-optimization) [Reinforcement fine-tuning\\\\\n\\\\\nFine-tune a reasoning model by grading its outputs.](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/reinforcement-fine-tuning)\n","structuredPatch":[]}}

This system is also not available currently for use with regional / sovereign endpoints.\n\n## [Available Compound Systems](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#available-compound-systems)\n\nThere are two compound systems available:\n\n- [`groq/compound`](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/systems/compound): supports multiple tool calls per request. This system is great for use cases that require multiple web searches or code executions per request.\n- [`groq/compound-mini`](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini): supports a single tool call per request. This system is great for use cases that require a single web search or code execution per request. `groq/compound-mini` has an average of 3x lower latency than `groq/compound`.\n\nBoth systems support the following tools:\n\n- [Web Search](https://console.groq.com/docs/web-search)\n- [Visit Website](https://console.groq.com/docs/visit-website)\n- [Code Execution](https://console.groq.com/docs/code-execution)\n- [Browser Automation](https://console.groq.com/docs/browser-automation)\n- [Wolfram Alpha](https://console.groq.com/docs/wolfram-alpha)\n\nCustom [user-provided tools](https://console.groq.com/docs/tool-use) are not supported at this time.\n\n## [Quickstart](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#quickstart)\n\nTo use compound systems, change the `model` parameter to either `groq/compound` or `groq/compound-mini`:\n\nPython\n\n```\n1from groq import Groq\n2\n3client = Groq()\n4\n5completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n6    messages=[\\\n7        {\\\n8            \"role\": \"user\",\\\n9            \"content\": \"What is the current weather in Tokyo?\",\\\n10        }\\\n11    ],\n12    # Change model to compound to use built-in tools\n13    # model: \"llama-3.3-70b-versatile\",\n14    model=\"groq/compound\",\n15)\n16\n17print(completion.choices[0].message.content)\n18# Print all tool calls\n19# print(completion.choices[0].message.executed_tools)\n```\n\nAnd that's it!\n\nWhen the API is called, it will intelligently decide when to use search or code execution to best answer the user's query.\nThese tool calls are performed on the server side, so no additional setup is required on your part to use built-in tools.\n\nIn the above example, the API will use its build in web search tool to find the current weather in Tokyo.\nIf you didn't use compound systems, you might have needed to add your own custom tools to make API requests to a weather service, then perform multiple API calls to Groq to get a final result.\nInstead, with compound systems, you can get a final result with a single API call.\n\n## [Executed Tools](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#executed-tools)\n\nTo view the tools (search or code execution) used automatically by the compound system, check the `executed_tools` field in the response:\n\nPython\n\n```\n1import os\n2from groq import Groq\n3\n4client = Groq(api_key=os.environ.get(\"GROQ_API_KEY\"))\n5\n6response = client.chat.completions.create(\n7    model=\"groq/compound\",\n8    messages=[\\\n9        {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What did Groq release last week?\"}\\\n10    ]\n11)\n12# Log the tools that were used to generate the response\n13print(response.choices[0].message.executed_tools)\n```\n\n## [Model Usage Details](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#model-usage-details)\n\nThe `usage_breakdown` field in responses provides detailed information about all the underlying models used during the compound system's execution.\n\nJSON\n\n```\n\"usage_breakdown\": {\n  \"models\": [\\\n    {\\\n      \"model\": \"llama-3.3-70b-versatile\",\\\n      \"usage\": {\\\n        \"queue_time\": 0.017298032,\\\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 226,\\\n        \"prompt_time\": 0.023959775,\\\n        \"completion_tokens\": 16,\\\n        \"completion_time\": 0.061639794,\\\n        \"total_tokens\": 242,\\\n        \"total_time\": 0.085599569\\\n      }\\\n    },\\\n    {\\\n      \"model\": \"openai/gpt-oss-120b\",\\\n      \"usage\": {\\\n        \"queue_time\": 0.019125835,\\\n        \"prompt_tokens\": 903,\\\n        \"prompt_time\": 0.033082052,\\\n        \"completion_tokens\": 873,\\\n        \"completion_time\": 1.776467372,\\\n        \"total_tokens\": 1776,\\\n        \"total_time\": 1.809549424\\\n      }\\\n    }\\\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## [System Versioning](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#system-versioning)\n\nCompound systems support versioning through the `Groq-Model-Version` header. In most cases, you won't need to change anything since you'll automatically be on the latest stable version. To view the latest changes to the compound systems, see the [Compound Changelog](https://console.groq.com/docs/changelog/compound).\n\n### [Available Systems and Versions](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#available-systems-and-versions)\n\n| System | Default Version<br>(no header) | Latest Version<br>( `Groq-Model-Version: latest`) | Previous Versions |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| [`groq/compound`](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/systems/compound) | `2025-08-16` (stable) | `2025-08-16` (latest) | `2025-07-23` |\n| [`groq/compound-mini`](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/systems/compound-mini) | `2025-08-16` (stable) | `2025-08-16` (latest) | `2025-07-23` |\n\n### [Version Details](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#version-details)\n\n- **Default (no header)**: Uses version `2025-08-16`, the most recent stable version that has been fully tested and deployed\n- **Latest** ( `Groq-Model-Version: latest`): Uses version `2025-08-16`, the prerelease version with the newest features before they're rolled out to everyone\n\nTo use a specific version, pass the version in the `Groq-Model-Version` header:\n\ncurl\n\n```\ncurl -X POST \"https://api.groq.com/openai/v1/chat/completions\" \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $GROQ_API_KEY\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"Groq-Model-Version: latest\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"model\": \"groq/compound\",\n    \"messages\": [{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"What is the weather today?\"}]\n  }'\n```\n\n## [What's Next?](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound\\#whats-next)\n\nNow that you understand the basics of compound systems, explore these topics:\n\n- **[Systems](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/systems)** \\- Learn about the two compound systems and when to use each one\n- **[Built-in Tools](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/built-in-tools)** \\- Learn about the built-in tools available in Groq's Compound systems\n- **[Search Settings](https://console.groq.com/docs/web-search#search-settings)** \\- Customize web search behavior with domain filtering\n- **[Use Cases](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound/use-cases)** \\- Explore practical applications and detailed examples\n\n### Was this page helpful?\n\nYesNoSuggest Edits\n\n#### On this page\n\n- [Available Compound Systems](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound#available-compound-systems)\n- [Quickstart](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound#quickstart)\n- [Executed Tools](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound#executed-tools)\n- [Model Usage Details](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound#model-usage-details)\n- [System Versioning](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound#system-versioning)\n- [What's Next?](https://console.groq.com/docs/compound#whats-next)\n\nStripeM-Inner\n","structuredPatch":[]}}

Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":39,"oldLines":8,"newStart":39,"newLines":14,"lines":[" -

scrape when implementing\n\n---\n\n## Scraping Strategy\n\n### Phase 1: Core Implementation (Immediate)\n**Target: ~40-50 pages**\n- LlamaIndex Python: Workflows, tools, LLM integration (~15 pages)\n- **LlamaIndex TypeScript**: Workflows, LLM packages, chat patterns (~10 pages)\n- OpenAI: Chat API, function calling, streaming, models (~15 pages)\n- Groq: OpenAI compatibility, rate limits, tool use (~5 pages)\n\n**Key Addition**: TypeScript LlamaIndex docs are CRITICAL as the frontend uses `@llamaindex/*` packages\n\n### Phase 2: Production Readiness (Next Sprint)\n**Target: ~20-30 pages**\n- Error handling patterns\n- Rate limits and billing optimization\n- Best practices for streaming\n- Evaluation and observability\n\n### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Future)\n**Target: ~30-40 pages**\n- RAG implementation (when adding content search)\n- Embeddings (for content similarity)\n- Batch processing (for bulk operations)\n- Fine-tuning (for custom models)\n\n**Total Estimated:** ~100-120 high-value pages vs 1,069 total available (~10% focused scraping)\n\n---\n\n## Implementation Notes\n\n### Dual Implementation Architecture\nThe platform uses a **dual AI architecture**:\n\n1. **Backend (Python)**: `/functions/AI_API/`\n   - Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":69,"oldLines":13,"newStart":69,"newLines":20,"lines":[" -

Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":86,"oldLines":6,"newStart":86,"newLines":8,"lines":[" "," ### Groq Documentation"," **Location:** `claude-docs/ai/groq/`","+","+#### Core"," -

Uses Python LlamaIndex workflows\n   - `llama_index.core.workflow` for workflow patterns\n   - `llama_index.llms.openai` for LLM integration\n   - Handles complex tool execution and data processing\n\n2. **Frontend (TypeScript)**: `/src/`\n   - Uses TypeScript LlamaIndex packages\n   - `@llamaindex/workflow` for client-side workflows\n   - `@llamaindex/openai` and `@llamaindex/groq` for model switching\n   - Implements SSE streaming for real-time responses\n   - Astro SSR API routes bridge frontend and backend\n\n### Key Documentation Gaps Identified\n1. **TypeScript LlamaIndex** - Not in original plan, but CRITICAL for frontend\n2. **Streaming Implementations** - Both OpenAI SSE and LlamaIndex streaming patterns\n3. **Groq Integration** - Used alongside OpenAI for model flexibility\n4. **Tool Execution** - Frontend ToolExecutor class needs tool definition patterns\n\n### Recommended Scraping Order\n1. **First**: LlamaIndex TypeScript (frontend depends on it)\n2. **Second**: OpenAI streaming + function calling (core features)\n3. **Third**: LlamaIndex Python workflows (backend enhancement)\n4. **Fourth**: Groq compatibility (production flexibility)\n\n","structuredPatch":[{"oldStart":137,"oldLines":9,"newStart":137,"newLines":28,"lines":[" -
