Find ALL files related to feature \"$1\":\n   - Components that implement it\n   - Stores that manage its state\n   - Composables that provide its logic\n   - API routes that support it\n   - Types that define it\n   - Tests that cover it\n\n2. Trace data flow:\n   - How data flows through the feature\n   - Which stores are involved\n   - Which composables are used\n   - Which components consume the data\n\n3. Document patterns:\n   - How this feature is architected\n   - Naming conventions used\n   - File organization\n   - Integration points\n\nMission 2 - Find Reusable Code for Addition:\n1. Find existing code that provides \"$2\" functionality:\n   - Exact matches (already does exactly this)\n   - Near matches (does 70-90% of this)\n   - Base components to extend\n   - Similar implementations to learn from\n\n2. Identify extension points:\n   - Where in existing feature to add \"$2\"\n   - Components that need new props/slots\n   - Stores that need new actions\n   - Composables that need extension\n\n3. Check for VueUse alternatives:\n   - Custom code that VueUse provides\n   - Patterns VueUse simplifies\n\nOutput: Create PRE_ANALYSIS.md in .temp/add-$1/ with:\n- Section 1: Existing Feature Map\n- Section 2: Reusability Analysis for Addition\n- Section 3: Extension Strategy Recommendations\n```\n\n**Spawn @documentation-researcher with mission:**\n```\nTask: Research VueUse solutions for adding \"$2\"\n\nFocus Areas:\n1. Search VueUse for composables that provide \"$2\" functionality\n2. Find examples of similar additions in documentation\n3. Identify patterns that simplify implementation\n4. Document usage examples\n\nOutput: Add VueUse findings to PRE_ANALYSIS.md\n```\n\n### Step 2: Main Agent Consolidates Findings\n\nAfter both agents complete:\n1. Read PRE_ANALYSIS.md\n2. Understand existing feature structure\n3. Identify best extension approach\n4. Note integration points\n\n## Phase 2: Planning\n\n**Objective:** Create minimal-change plan for adding functionality\n\n### Step 1: Spawn Planning Agent\n\n**Spawn @plan-master with mission:**\n```\nTask: Create plan for adding \"$2\" to existing feature \"$1\"\n\nContext:\n- Feature Name: $1\n- What to Add: $2\n- Command Type: add (extending existing feature)\n\nInput Files:\n- Read .temp/add-$1/PRE_ANALYSIS.md for feature map and extension opportunities\n\nPlanning Focus:\n1. **Extension-first approach:**\n   - Prefer modifying existing files over creating new ones\n   - Extend existing components with props/slots\n   - Add actions to existing stores\n   - Enhance existing composables\n\n2. **Minimal changes:**\n   - Change least amount of code necessary\n   - Preserve backward compatibility\n   - Don't refactor unrelated code\n\n3. **Integration strategy:**\n   - How to wire new functionality into existing feature\n   - Which files to modify\n   - What new files are absolutely necessary\n\n4. **Follow architecture hierarchy:**\n   - Check VueUse first (from pre-analysis)\n   - Extend existing composables or create new\n   - Extend existing stores or create new\n   - Extend existing components or create new\n\n5. **Plan phases:**\n   - Phase 1: Foundation (extend/create stores and composables)\n   - Phase 2: Implementation (extend/create components)\n   - Phase 3: Integration (wire into existing feature)\n   - Phase 4: Quality (tests, validation, regression checks)\n\n6. **Assign agents:**\n   - Determine which specialists are needed\n   - Define what they should extend/modify\n   - Specify deliverables\n\nOutput: Create MASTER_PLAN.md in .temp/add-$1/\n```\n\n### Step 2: Main Agent Reviews Plan\n\nAfter @plan-master completes:\n1. Read MASTER_PLAN.md\n2. Update TODO list with all tasks\n3. Verify plan minimizes changes\n\n### Step 3: ⚠️ PAUSE FOR USER APPROVAL ⚠️\n\n**Claude, you MUST stop here and present the plan to the user:**\n\n```\nI've analyzed existing feature \"$1\" and created a plan for adding \"$2\".
