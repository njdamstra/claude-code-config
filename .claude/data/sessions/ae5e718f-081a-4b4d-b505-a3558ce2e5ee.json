    "i meant like is it possible for it to output the final claude code response transcript into audio format using this system? ik we can customize the static message we're given notifying me when its done, but im wondering if we can output the entire transcript.",
    "yes proceed with implementing this. make sure to not delete any code, you can comment some stuff out, and add comments to your additions so that it can easily be rolled back!",
    "Can we create a slash command that can help manage the tts configuration we have. it can be called tts.md and it should be able to customize our tts and the hooks for tts in this slash command. it should ONLY include essential customizations, like turning it on / off completely, the output summary, the stop notifcation, etc. ",
    "Is it possible to create a system for stt (speech to text) in and for claude code? you can search the web if you'd like. what are the different options. i'd prefer to just create a slash command or a custom fn shortcut the lets me speak directly to claude code through the terminal. btw i have a macos and i use iTerm2 for my terminal.

    "yes lets test option 1 with hear right now!",
    "hear -d",
    "i wouldnt invoke it in this claude code session since this isn't the direct terminal command line, but i tested it in a standard terminal and it worked! ",
