    "okay this isn't working as expected. when you finished your response, i heard audio, but it was static and made me jump. it contained no words just static. while i have the openai key, i don't have the eleven labs key. First check the original implementation we're referencing in ~/claude-code-hooks-mastery, if everythings consistent with our setup, then search the web to see if you can find the issue for why i only hear static.
