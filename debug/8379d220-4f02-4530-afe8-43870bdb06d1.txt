Analyze this AIBrainstormingTheater component for performance issues, sizing/scaling problems, and reliability concerns. Specifically look for:

1. **Performance Issues:**
   - Unnecessary re-renders or computations
   - Animation loop inefficiencies
   - DOM manipulation bottlenecks
   - Memory leaks or resource cleanup issues

2. **Sizing/Scaling Problems:**
   - Elements that scale too small on mobile
   - Responsive calculation issues in brainstormLayout
   - Issues with the responsive animation system
   - Hardcoded sizes that don't scale properly

3. **Reliability Concerns:**
   - Race conditions in animations
   - Ref timing issues (elements not available when needed)
   - Animation state management problems
   - Issues with the useAnimation composable integration

4. **Component Architecture:**
   - How does the responsive scaling work (lines 126-162)?
   - What composables does it use and how?
   - Are there any anti-patterns or code smells?

Provide a detailed technical analysis with specific line numbers and concrete issues.""

**Card Animation Keyframes (lines 293-298):**
```typescript
keyframes: [
  { opacity: 0, transform: 'translate(-50%, 80px) scale(0.9)' },
  { opacity: 1, transform: 'translate(-50%, 0px) scale(1)', offset: 0.15 },

```

**brainstormLayout values (lines 186-188):**

cardEndOffset: Math.round(-120 * scale)   // e.g., -66px at 0.55 scale

**Problem:** The animation keyframes use HARDCODED pixel values (80px, 0px, -80px, -120px) but the CSS custom properties (`--card-start`, `--card-mid`, `--card-end`) are set to SCALED values.

The keyframes reference `var(--card-start)` etc. in the plan, but the ACTUAL CODE still has hardcoded values.

Compare the responsive sizing strategies across all 5 theater components. For each component, identify:

1. **Responsive Sizing Approach:**
   - Does it use `useAnimation` with `responsive` config?
   - Does it have MIN_SCALE/MAX_SCALE constants?
   - Does it compute scaled sizes based on container width?
   - Does it use mobile breakpoints with minimum sizes?

2. **Size Initialization:**
   - How are base sizes defined (constants, hardcoded, props)?
   - Are sizes reactive or static?
   - Is there a `brainstormLayout`-style computed property?

3. **Container Height Strategy:**
   - Fixed height, clamp(), v-bind, or inline styles?
   - Is there conflict between CSS and JS height sources?

4. **Element Scaling:**
   - Which elements scale (icons, text, spacing, animations)?
   - Are ALL elements scaled consistently or are some hardcoded?
   - Do animation keyframes use scaled values or hardcoded px?

5. **Inconsistencies:**
   - Which component is the "gold standard" (most complete)?
   - What patterns are missing in each component?
   - Are there conflicting approaches (some use responsive, others don't)?

Provide a **comparison matrix** showing:
- Component | Uses responsive | Mobile overrides | Scales all elements | Animation sync | Issues

Then recommend standardization approach.""

[GMCPT] [1762212396088] Starting: gemini "-p" ""@/Users/natedamstra/socialaize-worktrees/feat-landing-docs/src/components/vue/views/home/workflows/AIBrainstormingTheater.vue @/Users/natedamstra/socialaize-worktrees/feat-landing-docs/src/components/vue/views/home/workflows/SchedulingTheater.vue @/Users/natedamstra/socialaize-worktrees/feat-landing-docs/src/components/vue/views/home/workflows/AnalyticsTheater.vue

User reports: "AIBrainstormingTheater doesn't resize well - it stays the same size when browser resizes, while other theaters grow/shrink visibly."

Compare the ACTUAL responsive behavior:

**AIBrainstormingTheater responsive config (lines 136-145):**
```typescript
const responsiveAnimation = useAnimation(theaterRef, {
  responsive: {
    enabled: true,
    baselineWidth: MAX_CONTENT_WIDTH,
    minScale: MIN_SCALE,
    maxScale: MAX_SCALE
  },
  respectEnvironment: true
})
```

**SchedulingTheater responsive config:**
```typescript
const responsiveAnimation = useAnimation(theaterRef, {
  responsive: {
    enabled: true,
    baselineWidth: BASE_CONTENT_WIDTH,
    minScale: SCHED_MIN_SCALE,
    maxScale: SCHED_MAX_SCALE
  }
})
```

**AnalyticsTheater responsive config:**
```typescript
const responsiveAnimation = useAnimation(theaterRef, {
  responsive: {
    enabled: true,
    baselineWidth: ANALYTICS_MAX_CONTENT_WIDTH,
    minScale: ANALYTICS_MIN_SCALE,
    maxScale: ANALYTICS_MAX_SCALE
  }
})
```

**KEY QUESTIONS:**

1. Compare the MIN_SCALE and MAX_SCALE values across all three. Which component has the narrowest range?

2. Compare the baselineWidth values. Are they the same or different?

3. Look at the container CSS:
   - AIBrainstormingTheater: What's the max-height on `.ai-brainstorming-theater`?
   - SchedulingTheater: Does it have a max-height constraint?
   - AnalyticsTheater: Does it have a max-height constraint?

4. Check the dimension fallback:
   - AIBrainstormingTheater: `dimensions = responsiveAnimation.responsive?.dimensions ?? fallbackDimensions`
   - Do the other theaters use fallbacks or directly access dimensions?

5. What's causing the "stays same size" issue? Is it:
   - MAX_SCALE too low (capped at small size)?
   - max-height constraint in CSS (500px)?
   - baselineWidth mismatch?
   - Dimension tracking not working?

Provide specific line numbers and values for each component.""
