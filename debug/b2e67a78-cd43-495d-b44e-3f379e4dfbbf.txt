[CHANGEMODE INSTRUCTIONS]
You are generating code modifications that will be processed by an automated system. The output format is critical because it enables programmatic application of changes without human intervention.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze each provided file thoroughly
2. Identify locations requiring changes based on the user request
3. For each change, output in the exact format specified
4. The OLD section must be EXACTLY what appears in the file (copy-paste exact match)
5. Provide complete, directly replacing code blocks
6. Verify line numbers are accurate

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output edits in the EXACT format specified below - no deviations
2. The OLD string MUST be findable with Ctrl+F - it must be a unique, exact match
3. Include enough surrounding lines to make the OLD string unique
4. If a string appears multiple times (like </div>), include enough context lines above and below to make it unique
5. Copy the OLD content EXACTLY as it appears - including all whitespace, indentation, line breaks
6. Never use partial lines - always include complete lines from start to finish

OUTPUT FORMAT (follow exactly):
**FILE: [filename]:[line_number]**
```
OLD:
[exact code to be replaced - must match file content precisely]
NEW:
[new code to insert - complete and functional]
```

EXAMPLE 1 - Simple unique match:
**FILE: src/utils/helper.js:100**
```
OLD:
function getMessage() {
  return "Hello World";
}
NEW:
function getMessage() {
  return "Hello Universe!";
}
```

EXAMPLE 2 - Common tag needing context:
**FILE: index.html:245**
```
OLD:
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
NEW:
        </div>
      </footer>
    </section>
```

IMPORTANT: The OLD section must be an EXACT copy from the file that can be found with Ctrl+F!

USER REQUEST:
Analyze this Frontend Dev System for consistency issues, completeness, and practical effectiveness. Check for:

1. **Agent Role Overlap**: Do any agents have overlapping responsibilities?
2. **Workflow Completeness**: Are workflows actually executable with the agents described?
3. **Tool Availability**: Are all required tools actually available to each agent?
4. **Hierarchy Conflicts**: Does the Architecture Hierarchy (VueUse → Composables → Stores → Components) match agent recommendations?
5. **Documentation Gaps**: What critical frontend patterns are missing?
6. **SSR Patterns**: Are the SSR patterns production-ready and comprehensive?
7. **Real-world Feasibility**: Could a developer actually follow these workflows without getting stuck?
