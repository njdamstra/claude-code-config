Analyze this 2,642-line composable and answer:

1. **What features does it ALREADY provide?**
   - Does it have responsive scaling with baseValues?
   - Does it use VueUse utilities (useRafFn, useFps, useBattery)?
   - What's the sequence feature and how does it work?
   - Does it have environment detection (FPS, battery, reduced motion)?

2. **What are the ACTUAL bugs/issues?**
   - Where is the problematic sequence + timeout pattern?
   - Where does the autoplay watcher need hysteresis?
   - What causes cascade restarts?

3. **Should we FIX this composable or CREATE new ones?**
   - Is the issue the COMPOSABLE itself or how THEATERS use it?
   - What's the minimal fix needed?
