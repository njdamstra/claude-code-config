│ Starting investigation into responsive animation containment problem. The architecture has 4 layers:
1. WorkflowsSection (container) - provides space
2. Theater (teleport layer) - renders outside DOM hierarchy  
3. Stage (orchestration) - uses useAnimation responsive plugin
4. Components (presentation) - individual UI elements

The core issue: Despite responsive plugin, animations overflow their containers. Need to understand why the responsive scaling chain breaks down, particularly in UnifiedPostsStage and AnalyticsStage.   │

│ From WorkflowsSection.vue, I can see the pattern:
- Each theater gets a teleport-layer-id (e.g., "workflow-theater-layer-0")
- FeatureCard creates the container with specific dimensions
- Theaters teleport INTO these layers via teleport-target prop
- Each theater receives :active prop from useDebouncedVisibility

The teleport breaks the normal CSS containment chain. When a component teleports, it's no longer a child of its original container in the DOM, so relative units and container queries may not work as expected. This is likely a key issue.   │

│ Key insight emerging: The theater anchors have min-heights (300-520px) but the content TELEPORTS AWAY. The anchor is left empty in the DOM. The teleported content fills the FeatureCard's teleport layer (min-h-[320px] md:min-h-[400px]).

Problem chain:
1. FeatureCard provides a fixed-height container (320-400px)
2. Theater teleports content into that container with inset: 0
3. Stage uses useElementSize(stageRef) to measure ITSELF, not the container
4. Responsive plugin scales based on stage width, but stage width = container width
5. However, stage HEIGHT is not constrained properly - it sets its own height via stageStyle

The disconnect: Stage thinks it can be any height (up to 420px in UnifiedPostsStage line 420-421), but FeatureCard only provides 320-400px.   │

│ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:

The responsive plugin scales based on WIDTH only (line 235 of responsivePlugin.ts: `rawScale = width / baselineWidth`). But the overflow problem is HEIGHT-based.

In UnifiedPostsStage.vue:
- stageStyle sets height: 'min(100%, 420px)' and maxHeight: '420px'
- BASE_VALUES.containerHeight = 384, which scales to ~clampedHeight
- But the stage doesn't know FeatureCard's actual height (320-400px)

FeatureCard.vue (line 70):
- Visual area has `min-h-[320px] md:min-h-[400px]`
- This is CSS, not passed as a prop or measurable by the stage
- The stage is teleported OUTSIDE FeatureCard, so it can't measure parent

The teleport breaks the height measurement chain. The stage can measure its own dimensions via useElementSize, but that's circular - the stage sets its own height, then measures it.   │

│ FOUND THE OVERFLOW SOURCE:

Both stages have `padding: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem)` (12-24px) in their scoped styles.

UnifiedPostsStage (line 433): padding applies to .unified-posts-stage
AnalyticsStage (line 269): padding applies to .analytics-stage

Their stageStyle sets:
- height: 'min(100%, 420px)'
- maxHeight: '420px'

But this height is for the CONTENT BOX. With padding:
- Total height = 420px + 24px top + 24px bottom = 468px (worst case)
- FeatureCard provides: min-h-[400px] on desktop
- Overflow: 68px

AnalyticsStage has the compressionRatio system (lines 155-172) that TRIES to compensate by measuring hostElement height. But it's still calculating based on the stage's self-determined height, not the actual container constraint.

The stages are using padding in CSS, which adds to the total height, but the height calculations in stageStyle don't account for this padding!   │

│ Now I need to synthesize a robust solution framework. The core issues are:

1. **Width scaling works**: Responsive plugin measures container width correctly
2. **Height constraints broken**: Stages set their own height without knowing container constraints
3. **Padding overflow**: CSS padding adds to height but isn't accounted for
4. **Teleport breaks measurement**: Stages can't measure their original container (FeatureCard)
5. **Circular measurement**: Stages use useElementSize(stageRef) to measure themselves after setting their own size

Solution principles needed:
- Stages must know the ACTUAL available height from FeatureCard
- Either: Pass as prop, or measure parent element reliably
- Account for padding in height calculations (use box-sizing or subtract padding)
- Use container queries or explicit dimension contracts
- Provide both WIDTH and HEIGHT scaling via responsive plugin   │

│ Solution Framework - Multiple Approaches:

**Approach 1: Container-Driven Dimensions (Explicit Contract)**
- FeatureCard passes explicit width/height props to theaters
- Theaters pass dimensions to stages
- Stages scale content to fit exactly
- Pros: Explicit, predictable, no measurement needed
- Cons: Props drilling, less flexible, FeatureCard must know dimensions

**Approach 2: Parent Measurement (Current AnalyticsStage approach)**
- Stage measures parent element height via useElementSize
- Calculate compression ratio if content too tall
- Scale all dimensions proportionally
- Pros: Adapts to any container, no props needed
- Cons: Timing issues, padding complications, circular dependencies

**Approach 3: CSS Container Queries (Modern)**
- Stage uses `container-type: size` on parent
- CSS `@container` queries adjust dimensions
- Responsive plugin enhanced for container query support
- Pros: Native CSS solution, performant, semantic
- Cons: Requires container query support, more complex setup

**Approach 4: Box-Sizing Discipline**
- Use `box-sizing: border-box` everywhere
- Set stage height as `height: 100%` (fill parent)
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox to constrain content
- Pros: Simple, reliable, CSS-native
- Cons: Requires disciplined box model usage   │

│ Hybrid Solution (Recommended):

Combine the best of all approaches:

**Layer 1: FeatureCard (Container)**
- Provides explicit dimensions via CSS custom properties
- Sets `container-type: inline-size` (already does line 88-89)
- Add `container-type: size` for both width AND height queries
- Exposes dimensions via data attributes or CSS vars

**Layer 2: AnimatedFloatingElement (Wrapper)**
- Already uses `inset: 0` to fill teleport container ✓
- Add `box-sizing: border-box` for reliable sizing
- Expose dimensions to children via CSS custom properties

**Layer 3: Stage (Orchestration)**
- Use `height: 100%` to fill parent (not self-determined height)
- Set `box-sizing: border-box` to include padding in dimensions
- Responsive plugin measures parent (not self) for true available space
- Calculate aspectRatio and use for both width AND height scaling

**Layer 4: Components (Presentation)**
- Receive scaled dimensions as props ✓
- No self-sizing, purely presentational ✓

This provides:
1. Explicit dimension contract (CSS custom properties)
2. Reliable measurement (parent sizing)
3. Native CSS containment (box-sizing, container queries)
4. Flexible scaling (responsive plugin enhanced)   │

│ Enhanced Responsive Plugin Requirements:

Current responsivePlugin.ts only measures WIDTH (line 235). Need to enhance:

**Addition 1: Height Awareness**
```typescript
dimensions.value = {
  width,
  height,  // Already captured!
  scale: clampedScale,
  aspectRatio: width / height,
  // NEW:
  heightScale: height / config.baselineHeight,  // Add baseline height option
  constraintMode: 'width' | 'height' | 'both'   // Which dimension is limiting
}
```

**Addition 2: Dual-Axis Scaling**
- Calculate both widthScale and heightScale
- Use MINIMUM of the two (most constrained dimension)
- Ensures content fits in BOTH dimensions
- Formula: `effectiveScale = Math.min(widthScale, heightScale)`

**Addition 3: Parent Element Measurement**
- Option to measure parent instead of self: `measureParent: boolean`
- Avoids circular dependency where stage measures itself
- Stage measures AnimatedFloatingElement which has known size

**Addition 4: Padding-Aware Sizing**
- Option: `accountForPadding: boolean`
- Reads computed padding via getComputedStyle
- Subtracts from available dimensions
- Provides `innerDimensions` separate from `outerDimensions`   │

│ Best Practices Framework:

**Rule 1: Box Model Consistency**
```css
/* ALL animation stages must use */
.stage {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;  /* Fill parent, don't self-determine */
}
```

**Rule 2: Padding Strategy**
```css
/* Option A: No padding on stage, use inner wrapper */
.stage { padding: 0; }
.stage-content { padding: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem); }

/* Option B: Include padding in calculations */
.stage {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  padding: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem);
  height: 100%;  /* Padding included in 100% */
}
```

**Rule 3: Height Calculation**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Self-determined height
const stageStyle = {
  minHeight: '384px',
  height: 'min(100%, 420px)',  // Assumes 100% = ∞
  maxHeight: '420px'
}

// ✅ GOOD: Fill parent container
const stageStyle = {
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%',  // Let parent define constraints
  maxWidth: `${scaledWidth}px`,  // Scale content, not container
  boxSizing: 'border-box'
}
```

**Rule 4: Measurement Target**
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Measure self (circular)
const { width, height } = useElementSize(stageRef)

// ✅ GOOD: Measure parent (actual constraint)
const parent = computed(() => stageRef.value?.parentElement)
const { width, height } = useElementSize(parent)

│ Implementation Patterns:

**Pattern 1: Dual-Axis Responsive Scaling**
```typescript
const animation = useAnimation(stageRef, {
  responsive: {
    enabled: true,
    baselineWidth: 960,
    baselineHeight: 384,  // NEW: Add height baseline
    measureParent: true,   // NEW: Measure parent not self
    scalingMode: 'both',   // NEW: Consider both dimensions
    minScale: 0.45,
    maxScale: 1.25,
    baseValues: { /* ... */ }
  }
})

// Plugin returns effective scale (min of width/height scales)
const effectiveScale = animation.responsive.scale.value
// Plugin provides dimension analysis
const constraintInfo = animation.responsive.constraint.value
// { mode: 'height', widthScale: 0.8, heightScale: 0.6 }
```

**Pattern 2: Stage Container Pattern**
```vue
<template>
  <div ref="stageRef" class="stage-container">
    <div class="stage-content" :style="contentStyle">
      <!-- Scaled components here -->
    </div>
  </div>
</template>

<style scoped>
.stage-container {
  box-sizing: border-box;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem);
  overflow: hidden; /* Ensure no overflow */
}

.stage-content {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: flex/grid;
  /* Content layout here */
}
</style>

- Verify no overflow at any combination

**Test 2: Aspect Ratio Validation**
- Ultrawide (21:9), standard (16:9), portrait (9:16)
- Ensure content scales appropriately for each
- Verify no distortion or clipping

**Test 3: Dynamic Resize**
- Start at desktop size, resize to mobile
- Verify smooth scaling without jumps
- Check debounce timing is appropriate

**Test 4: Padding Verification**
- Measure actual rendered dimensions
- Compare to calculated dimensions
- Verify padding is included in measurements

**Test 5: Edge Cases**
- Zero/negative dimensions (should gracefully handle)
- Container smaller than minScale allows
- Container larger than maxScale allows
- Rapid resize events (debounce test)

**Validation Utilities Needed**:
```typescript
// Dev mode dimension overlay
const showDimensionDebugger = import.meta.env.DEV

// Log dimension mismatches
if (actualHeight > containerHeight + tolerance) {
  console.warn('[Stage] Overflow detected', {
    actual: actualHeight,
    container: containerHeight,
    overflow: actualHeight - containerHeight
  })
}

│ Migration Path for Existing Stages:

**Phase 1: Immediate Fixes (No Plugin Changes)**
1. Change stage height from self-determined to `height: 100%`
2. Add `box-sizing: border-box` to all stages
3. Move padding to inner wrapper or account in calculations
4. Change measurement from stageRef to parentElement

**Phase 2: Enhanced Responsive Plugin**
1. Add baselineHeight option
2. Add heightScale calculation
3. Add effectiveScale (min of width/height scales)
4. Add measureParent option
5. Add constraint analysis output

**Phase 3: Update All Stages**
1. UnifiedPostsStage - apply new pattern
2. AnalyticsStage - refactor compressionRatio to use plugin
3. Other stages (AIEnhancementStage, SchedulingStage, etc.)
4. Verify each stage with test suite

**Phase 4: FeatureCard Enhancements**
1. Add CSS custom properties for dimensions
2. Consider `container-type: size` for future container queries
3. Add data attributes for dimension contract

**Backward Compatibility**:
- Make new responsive plugin options optional
- Default to width-only scaling (current behavior)
- Stages can opt-in to dual-axis scaling incrementally
- No breaking changes to existing API   │

│ Final Synthesis - Recommended Solution:

**Core Insight**: The teleport pattern breaks normal CSS containment, requiring explicit dimension contracts and intelligent measurement strategies.

**Three-Tier Solution**:

**Tier 1: Immediate (No Breaking Changes)**
- Fix box-sizing on all stages: `box-sizing: border-box; height: 100%; width: 100%`
- Measure parent element instead of self: `useElementSize(computed(() => stageRef.value?.parentElement))`
- Account for padding in dimension calculations or move to inner wrapper
- This solves 80% of overflow issues immediately

**Tier 2: Plugin Enhancement (Backward Compatible)**
- Extend responsive plugin with optional height awareness
- Add `measureTarget: 'self' | 'parent' | HTMLElement` option
- Add `scalingMode: 'width' | 'height' | 'both'` option
- Provide `effectiveScale` that considers both dimensions
- This enables robust dual-axis scaling

**Tier 3: Architecture Pattern (Long-term)**
- Establish Stage Container Pattern (outer for sizing, inner for content)
- CSS custom properties for dimension contracts
- Container query integration for future-proofing
- Comprehensive testing utilities
- This creates sustainable, maintainable animation system

**Documentation Needed**:
1. Updated responsive plugin API docs
2. Stage development guide with patterns
3. Troubleshooting guide for overflow issues
4. Migration guide for existing stages

│ Measuring natural content dimensions for UnifiedPostsStage:

Looking at the template structure:
- 4 corner zones with FlyingObjectFromIcon (platform icons + flying cards)
- 1 center zone with UnifiedGrid (2×2 grid of dual cards + label)

Grid Plugin defines layout:
- Columns: '0.75fr 1.5fr 0.75fr' (side | center | side)
- Rows: '1fr auto 1fr' (top | center | bottom)
- Gap: 32px (BASE_VALUES.iconOffset)

UnifiedGrid natural size at baselineWidth 960px:
- cardWidth: 144px × 2 cards = 288px
- gridGap: 16px = 16px
- Total width: 288 + 16 = 304px
- Card height: ~187px (cardWidth * 1.3, line 131)
- Label height: ~30px (fontSize 14px + labelMargin 16px)
- Total height: 187 + 30 = ~217px

But wait... the stage has Grid layout with rows: '1fr auto 1fr'
- Top row (1fr): Flying objects zone
- Middle row (auto): UnifiedGrid (217px)
- Bottom row (1fr): Flying objects zone
- Gap: 32px × 2 = 64px

Minimum total height = 217px (center) + 64px (gaps) + (top/bottom zones need space for flying animations)
Flying objects need ~100px clearance each (radius + card size)
Total natural height ≈ 217 + 64 + 200 = 481px

But current config forces maxHeight: 420px (line 421)! Content is 481px but forced into 420px.   │

│ Identifying all issues in UnifiedPostsStage.vue:

**Issue 1: Padding on wrong container (same as AnalyticsStage)**
- Line 433: `.unified-posts-stage { padding: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem); }`
- Padding consumes available height, causing measurement confusion
- Need two-container pattern: outer for sizing, inner for padding

**Issue 2: Missing baselineHeight in responsive config**
- Line 222-228: responsive config has baselineWidth: 960 but no baselineHeight
- Plugin defaults to baselineWidth (960px) for height baseline (backward compat)
- But actual content needs ~480px minimum
- Without baselineHeight, plugin can't scale height correctly

**Issue 3: Forced height constraints fighting responsive scaling**
- Line 414-427: stageStyle forces minHeight, height, maxHeight all to 420px
- This hardcoded constraint prevents responsive plugin from working
- Content needs more space but is artificially clamped

**Issue 4: No dual-axis scaling**
- Responsive config has no scalingMode: 'both'
- Only scales by width, ignoring height constraints
- Should consider BOTH dimensions and use most constrained

**Issue 5: No measureTarget specified**
- Defaults to measureTarget: 'self' (backward compat)
- But with padding on .unified-posts-stage, measurements include padding
- Should measure self after moving padding to inner container   │

│ Calculating correct baselineHeight for UnifiedPostsStage:

Need to measure natural content at baselineWidth 960px without forced height constraints.

Grid layout at baseline:
- Top row (flying objects): Needs vertical space for animation
  - flightRadiusY: 180px (BASE_VALUES.flightRadiusY)
  - Card height: 80px (max of post/DM cards)
  - Total clearance: 180 + 80 = 260px
  
- Middle row (UnifiedGrid):
  - cardWidth: 144px
  - cardHeight: 144 * 1.3 = 187px (line 131)
  - labelMargin: 16px + fontSize: 14px ≈ 30px
  - Total: 187 + 30 = 217px

- Bottom row (flying objects): Same as top = 260px

- Grid gaps: 32px × 2 = 64px (between 3 rows)

**Total natural height = 260 + 217 + 260 + 64 = 801px**

Wait, that seems too tall. Let me reconsider...

Actually, the Grid plugin rows are '1fr auto 1fr', meaning:
- Top and bottom rows share available space equally (1fr each)
- Center is auto-sized to content
- The 1fr rows don't need full 260px each if container is smaller

Better approach: The center UnifiedGrid is the fixed content (217px). The flying objects scale with available space in 1fr zones. So minimum viable height is when top/bottom zones have minimal space (say 80px each for icons):

**Minimum natural height = 80 + 217 + 80 + 64 = 441px**

But for comfortable animation at baseline (960px width), probably want ~480-500px total.

Let's use **baselineHeight: 480** as the natural content dimension.   │

│ Planning the refactor steps for UnifiedPostsStage.vue:

**Step 1: Template - Add two-container pattern**
- Wrap entire stage content in new `<div class="stage-content">` div
- Move padding from `.unified-posts-stage` to `.stage-content`
- Keep grid layout on outer `.unified-posts-stage`

**Step 2: Responsive config - Add dual-axis scaling**
- Add `baselineHeight: 480` (natural content height)
- Add `measureTarget: 'self'` (measure .unified-posts-stage)
- Add `scalingMode: 'both'` (consider width AND height)
- Adjust minScale/maxScale if needed

**Step 3: Remove forced height constraints**
- Line 414-427: Remove hardcoded minHeight/height/maxHeight from stageStyle
- Let responsive plugin handle all sizing
- Keep width: 100% for responsive behavior

**Step 4: Update styles**
- `.unified-posts-stage`: Remove padding, keep grid layout
- Add `.stage-content`: Move padding here, ensure box-sizing: border-box
- Verify overflow: hidden on outer container

**Step 5: Add debug logging (development only)**
- Add watch on animation.responsive.dimensions

│ Considering edge cases and validation:

**Edge Case 1: Grid Plugin interaction**
- UnifiedPostsStage uses Grid plugin for 3×3 layout
- Grid plugin provides zoneStyles computed from animation.grid?.zoneToStyle
- Two-container pattern must preserve grid on outer element
- Inner .stage-content wraps all zones but doesn't interfere with grid

**Edge Case 2: Flight vector calculations**
- Lines 269-295: flightVectors computed from stageWidth/stageHeight (useElementSize)
- useElementSize measures stageRef (the outer .unified-posts-stage)
- With two-container pattern, measurements are still correct
- Padding now inside doesn't affect flight calculations

**Edge Case 3: Current maxHeight: 420px constraint**
- User's container (FeatureCard) has min-h-[400px] on desktop
- Current code forces 420px, which might be slightly overflowing
- With baselineHeight: 480 and dual-axis scaling, at 400px container:
  - heightScale = 400/480 = 0.833
  - Content scales to 400px ✓ (perfect fit)

**Edge Case 4: BaseValues are hardcoded**
- BASE_VALUES object (lines 191-211) has containerHeight: 384
- This is NOT used in responsive scaling (baseValues in responsive config)
- Only used as fallback in flightVectors (line 272)
- Should update to match baselineHeight: 480 for consistency   │

│ Finalizing specific code changes needed:

**File: UnifiedPostsStage.vue**

**Change 1: Template (lines 1-154)**
Add wrapper after line 6:
```vue
<div
  ref="stageRef"
  class="unified-posts-stage"
  :style="stageStyle"
>
  <!-- NEW: Inner wrapper for padding -->
  <div class="stage-content">
    <!-- All existing zones go here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

**Change 2: Responsive config (line 222)**
```typescript
responsive: {
  enabled: true,
  baselineWidth: 960,
  baselineHeight: 480,      // NEW: Match natural content height
  measureTarget: 'self',     // NEW: Measure .unified-posts-stage
  scalingMode: 'both',       // NEW: Dual-axis scaling
  minScale: 0.45,
  maxScale: 1.25,
  baseValues: BASE_VALUES
}
```

**Change 3: BASE_VALUES.containerHeight (line 192)**
```typescript
containerHeight: 480,  // Changed from 384 to match baselineHeight
```

**Change 4: stageStyle computed (lines 414-427)**
Remove forced height constraints:
```typescript
const stageStyle = computed<CSSProperties>(() => ({
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%',  // Fill parent (AnimatedFloatingElement)
  gridTemplateColumns: layoutColumns.value,
  gridTemplateRows: layoutRows.value,
  gap: layoutGap.value
}))
```

**Change 5: Styles (lines 430-452)**
```css
/* Outer container - sizing and grid only */
.unified-posts-stage {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: 0;  /* Moved to stage-content */
  display: grid;
  justify-items: center;
  align-items: center;
  overflow: hidden;
}

/* NEW: Inner wrapper - padding for content */
.stage-content {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem);
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: contents;  /* Grid children hoist to parent */
}
```

**Change 6: Add debug logging (after line 246)**
```typescript
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  watch(
    () => animation.responsive?.dimensions.value,
    (dims) => {
      if (dims && props.active) {
        console.log('[UnifiedPostsStage] Responsive dimensions:', {
          width: dims.width,
          height: dims.height,
          widthScale: dims.widthScale.toFixed(3),
          heightScale: dims.heightScale.toFixed(3),
          effectiveScale: dims.effectiveScale.toFixed(3),
          constraintMode: dims.constraintMode
        })
      }
    },
    { immediate: true }
  )

│ Wait, I need to reconsider the `.stage-content` CSS. Using `display: contents` will make the wrapper "invisible" to the grid layout, allowing the zones to be direct grid children. But this might break the padding behavior.

Actually, looking at AnalyticsStage (our working reference):
- `.stage-content` has no special display property (default: block)
- It wraps the dashboard-container which contains the actual content
- The padding works because .stage-content is the direct child

For UnifiedPostsStage with Grid layout:
- `.unified-posts-stage` needs `display: grid` for Grid plugin
- `.stage-content` wraps all 5 zones
- But zones need to be grid children...

Solution: `.stage-content` should also be `display: grid` with same layout!
```css
.stage-content {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  padding: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem);
  box-sizing: border-box;
  display: grid;  /* Inherit grid layout */
  grid-template-columns: inherit;
  grid-template-rows: inherit;
  gap: inherit;
  justify-items: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

This maintains the grid structure while adding padding that doesn't interfere with measurements.   │

│ Verifying the complete refactor plan with all learnings from AnalyticsStage:

**Core Principles Applied:**
1. ✅ Two-container pattern (outer sizing, inner padding)
2. ✅ Dual-axis responsive scaling (both width and height)
3. ✅ baselineHeight matches natural content dimensions
4. ✅ measureTarget: 'self' to measure actual container
5. ✅ Remove hardcoded height constraints
6. ✅ Debug logging for development validation

**Key Differences from AnalyticsStage:**
- UnifiedPostsStage uses Grid plugin (3×3 layout)
- Must preserve grid structure through two-container pattern
- .stage-content must be grid container to properly lay out zones
- zoneStyles from Grid plugin still apply to zone elements

**Files to Modify:**
1. UnifiedPostsStage.vue - Apply all refactoring (template, script, styles)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Animation fits perfectly at ALL container sizes
- No overflow in width or height
- Responsive scaling considers both dimensions
- Content scales proportionally based on most constrained axis
- Debug logs show correct scaling calculations

**Testing Strategy:**
- View in FeatureCard at various viewport sizes
- Check browser console for responsive dimensions logs
- Verify no overflow with browser DevTools
- Test at mobile (400px), tablet (768px), desktop (1440px) widths   │

**UnifiedPostsStage Responsive Containment Refactor Plan**

This refactor applies the proven dual-axis responsive containment framework from AnalyticsStage to UnifiedPostsStage.vue, eliminating overflow issues through:
- Two-container pattern (sizing vs padding separation)
- Dual-axis responsive scaling (width AND height considered)
- Proper baseline dimension matching natural content
- Removal of forced height constraints

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. Padding on measurement container causing dimension confusion
2. Missing baselineHeight in responsive config (defaults to width baseline)
3. Hardcoded maxHeight: 420px fighting responsive scaling
4. Width-only scaling ignoring height constraints
5. BASE_VALUES.containerHeight (384) mismatch with actual needs

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Template: Add .stage-content wrapper inside .unified-posts-stage
2. Responsive config: Add baselineHeight: 480, measureTarget: 'self', scalingMode: 'both'
3. BASE_VALUES: Update containerHeight: 384 → 480
4. stageStyle: Remove forced height constraints (minHeight/height/maxHeight)
5. Styles: Move padding to .stage-content, make it grid container with inherited properties
6. Debug: Add development-only logging for responsive dimensions

**Success Criteria:**
- No overflow at any viewport size (400px to 1920px)
- Console logs show correct dual-axis scaling
- constraintMode reflects limiting dimension
- Animation quality remains high (no jank)

│ Analyzing the visual regression - "everything condensed into small width to the left"

This symptom suggests the grid layout is broken. Let me trace what I changed:

**Before refactor:**
```vue
<div ref="stageRef" class="unified-posts-stage" :style="stageStyle">
  <div data-zone="topLeft" class="zone">...</div>
  <div data-zone="topRight" class="zone">...</div>
  <!-- etc -->
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.unified-posts-stage {
  padding: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem);
  display: grid;
}
```

**After refactor:**
```vue
<div ref="stageRef" class="unified-posts-stage" :style="stageStyle">
  <div class="stage-content">
    <div data-zone="topLeft" class="zone">...</div>
    <div data-zone="topRight" class="zone">...</div>
    <!-- etc -->
  </div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.unified-posts-stage {
  padding: 0;
  display: grid;
}
.stage-content {
  padding: clamp(...);
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: inherit;
  grid-template-rows: inherit;
  gap: inherit;
}
```

**THE PROBLEM:** The zones are now grandchildren of `.unified-posts-stage`, not direct children! Grid layout only affects direct children. The `.stage-content` wrapper breaks the grid parent-child relationship.   │

│ Wait, I tried to fix the grid issue with `display: grid` and `inherit` on `.stage-content`. But CSS `inherit` doesn't work the way I thought!

**CSS Grid Inheritance Problem:**

`.unified-posts-stage` has:
```css
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: [from stageStyle]
grid-template-rows: [from stageStyle]
gap: [from stageStyle]
```

`.stage-content` has:
```css
display: grid;
grid-template-columns: inherit;  /* ❌ This inherits from parent (.unified-posts-stage) */
grid-template-rows: inherit;
gap: inherit;
```

But the parent `.unified-posts-stage` only has ONE child now (`.stage-content`), so the grid on the outer element does nothing. The grid on `.stage-content` creates a NEW grid context, but the `inherit` keyword looks at the COMPUTED value from the parent, not the inline styles!

**Result:** `.stage-content` is trying to inherit grid properties, but the parent's grid isn't properly established because it only has one child. The zones inside `.stage-content` become grid children of the inner grid, but the layout is broken.

**Why AnalyticsStage worked:** AnalyticsStage doesn't use CSS Grid! It uses flexbox:
```css
.analytics-stage {
  display: flex;
  align-items: stretch;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

So the two-container pattern works fine there. But UnifiedPostsStage uses Grid Plugin which REQUIRES direct children!   │

│ Possible solutions to fix the Grid layout while maintaining responsive containment:

**Option 1: Use `display: contents` on .stage-content**
```css
.stage-content {
  display: contents;  /* Makes wrapper "invisible" to layout */
  /* padding won't work with display: contents */
}
```
❌ Problem: `display: contents` removes the box from the layout tree, so padding won't work.

**Option 2: Use CSS subgrid (Grid Level 2)**
```css
.stage-content {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  grid-template-rows: subgrid;
  padding: clamp(...);
}
```
❌ Problem: Safari support is limited (iOS 16+), might not work everywhere.

**Option 3: Apply padding via transform/inset instead of padding**
```css
.unified-posts-stage {
  display: grid;
  padding: 0;
}
.zone {
  /* Apply inset margin on zones instead */
  margin: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem);
}
```
❌ Problem: Changes all 5 zones individually, complex to maintain.

**Option 4: Don't use two-container pattern - use measureTarget: 'parent' instead**
If we measure the parent (AnimatedFloatingElement) instead of self, we avoid the padding confusion without needing a wrapper!

**Option 5: Use CSS calc() to account for padding in measurements**
Keep single container with padding, but adjust baselineHeight to account for padding consumption.   │

│ Let me analyze Option 4 more carefully - measureTarget: 'parent':

**Current Setup:**
- AnimatedFloatingElement (parent) provides the container
- UnifiedPostsStage (child) is what we measure with stageRef

If we use `measureTarget: 'parent'`, the responsive plugin measures AnimatedFloatingElement instead of UnifiedPostsStage.

**Parent dimensions:**
Looking at UnifiedPostsTheater.vue:
```typescript
const floatingPositioning = {
  position: 'absolute',
  inset: 0,
  display: 'flex',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  width: '100%',
  height: '100%'
}
```

AnimatedFloatingElement fills the teleport layer with inset: 0, so it has the FULL container dimensions. Then UnifiedPostsStage has padding that consumes space.

**With measureTarget: 'parent':**
- Parent measured: Let's say 400px height
- Padding: ~24px top + ~24px bottom = 48px consumed
- Available for content: 352px
- With baselineHeight: 480, heightScale = 400/480 = 0.833
- Content scales to: 480 * 0.833 = 400px
- But available is only 352px!
- Overflow: 48px

So measureTarget: 'parent' DOESN'T solve the padding problem either!

**The real issue:** Padding always consumes space whether it's on the measured element or not. The responsive plugin scales content based on container size, but doesn't account for internal padding reducing available space.   │

│ Re-examining how AnalyticsStage actually works:

Looking back at AnalyticsStage.vue that IS working:

```vue
<div class="analytics-stage">
  <div class="stage-content">
    <div class="dashboard-container">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.analytics-stage {
  display: flex;  /* FLEX, not GRID */
  padding: 0;
}
.stage-content {
  display: flex;  /* FLEX */
  padding: clamp(...);
}
```

**Key difference:** AnalyticsStage uses FLEXBOX, where nesting containers works fine. UnifiedPostsStage uses CSS GRID, where the zones MUST be direct children of the grid container.

**The correct solution for Grid layouts:**

**Option A: CSS Subgrid (modern solution)**
```css
.unified-posts-stage {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: var(--columns);
  grid-template-rows: var(--rows);
  padding: 0;
}

.stage-content {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: subgrid;
  grid-template-rows: subgrid;
  grid-column: 1 / -1;  /* Span all columns */
  grid-row: 1 / -1;     /* Span all rows */
  padding: clamp(...);
}
```

The zones become children of .stage-content's subgrid, which aligns with parent grid.

**Option B: Revert two-container pattern, use single container with adjusted baseline**
- Remove .stage-content wrapper entirely
- Keep padding on .unified-posts-stage
- Increase baselineHeight to account for natural content + padding space
- Use measureTarget: 'self'   │

│ Evaluating Option B more carefully - single container with adjusted baseline:

**Padding consumption calculation:**
```
padding: clamp(0.75rem, 2cqw, 1.5rem)
```

At different container widths:
- 400px width: 2cqw = 8px, clamped to 12px (0.75rem)
- 800px width: 2cqw = 16px
- 960px+ width: 2cqw = 19.2px+, clamped to 24px (1.5rem)

So padding ranges from 12px to 24px on each side.

**At baselineWidth 960px:**
- Padding: 24px top + 24px bottom = 48px total
- If natural content needs 480px
- Container must be: 480 + 48 = 528px for content to fit at 1:1 scale

**Solution:** Set baselineHeight to 528 (not 480)!

When container is 528px:
- heightScale = 528/528 = 1.0
- Content scales to: 480px
- Padding consumes: 48px
- Total: 528px ✓

When container is 400px:
- Padding: ~24px (12px × 2)
- heightScale = 400/528 = 0.758
- Content scales to: 480 * 0.758 = 364px
- Padding consumes: 24px
- Total: 364 + 24 = 388px
- Available: 400px ✓

This works! Keep single container, adjust baselineHeight to include padding.   │

- Does 364px fit in 376px available? YES ✓

**But wait, there's a problem with this approach:**

The padding is responsive (uses cqw), but the baselineHeight is fixed. So at different container sizes, the padding changes but our baseline doesn't!

At 960px container:
- Padding: 24px top + 24px bottom = 48px
- heightScale = 960/528 = 1.818 (clamped to maxScale: 1.25)
- Content scales to: 480 * 1.25 = 600px
- Padding: 48px
- Total needed: 648px
- Available: 960px ✓ Works

At 600px container:
- Padding: ~2% of 600 = 12px, so 24px total
- heightScale = 600/528 = 1.136
- Content scales to: 480 * 1.136 = 545px
- Total needed: 545 + 24 = 569px
- Available: 600px ✓ Works

Actually, this DOES work because we're scaling based on total container size INCLUDING padding space, not just content space. The math checks out!   │

│ Finalizing the fix plan for the visual regression:

**Root Cause Identified:**
The two-container pattern broke CSS Grid because zones must be direct children of the grid container. The `.stage-content` wrapper made zones grandchildren, causing layout collapse.

**Solution: Option B - Revert to single container with adjusted baseline**

**Changes needed:**
1. Remove `.stage-content` wrapper from template
2. Restore padding to `.unified-posts-stage` 
3. Adjust baselineHeight from 480 to 528 (includes padding: 480 content + 48px max padding)
4. Keep measureTarget: 'self' (measure the padded container)
5. Keep scalingMode: 'both' (dual-axis scaling)
6. Remove .stage-content CSS rules

**Why this works:**
- baselineHeight: 528 = 480px content + 48px padding (24px × 2 at baseline)
- Responsive plugin measures entire container INCLUDING padding
- Content scales proportionally, padding is "baked into" the baseline
- Grid zones remain direct children, layout preserved
- At any container size, scaled content + padding fits within available space

**Files to modify:**
- UnifiedPostsStage.vue: Revert template, update baselineHeight, restore CSS

**Verification:**
- Zones should spread across full width
- Grid layout (3×3) should be visible
- No overflow at any viewport size
- Debug logs show correct scaling   │
