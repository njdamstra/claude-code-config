│ Looking at the autoplay configuration more carefully. The stagger animation at line 494 uses:
```
autoplay: {
  threshold: 0.25,
  enabled: computed(() => props.active)
}
```

This means the animation will trigger whenever:
1. Element becomes visible (threshold 0.25)
2. AND props.active is true

The glitch hypothesis: If the component's visibility changes (scrolling in/out) OR if props.active toggles, the animation restarts. This could cause multiple restarts in quick succession.   │

│ The stagger animation has THREE separate triggers:
1. Intersection Observer (threshold: 0.25) - fires when element crosses 25% visibility
2. props.active changes - reactive computed ref
3. useAnimation's internal watchers that monitor element visibility

Problem identified: The intersection observer might fire multiple times as the user scrolls, especially near the threshold boundary. Combined with props.active reactivity, this creates a "restart loop."

Additionally, the .metric-card elements have `opacity: 0` in their initial CSS (line 605), which means they're hidden until animated. If the animation restarts mid-sequence, they flash back to opacity: 0.   │

│ Root cause analysis:
The glitchiness is likely caused by:

1. **Dual autoplay triggers**: Both intersection observer AND props.active reactive ref
2. **No "play once" guard**: Animation can replay multiple times without debouncing
3. **Scroll jitter at threshold**: Near 25% visibility, small scrolls cause rapid in/out events
4. **Initial opacity: 0**: When animation restarts, cards flash to invisible state

The fix needs to:
- Add a "hasPlayed" flag to prevent replays
- OR remove intersection observer and rely solely on props.active
- OR add significant debouncing to intersection observer
- OR use a different approach: manual play() control instead of autoplay   │

│ Comparing solution approaches:

**Option A: Remove autoplay, use manual control**
- Store animation controller from useAnimation
- Watch props.active, call play() once when true
- Use a ref to track if animation has played
- Pro: Full control, no restart glitches
- Con: Need to modify existing useAnimation composable return

**Option B: Disable intersection observer**
- Set autoplay.threshold to undefined/null
- Keep autoplay.enabled: computed(() => props.active)
- Pro: Minimal change
- Con: Still could restart if props.active toggles

**Option C: Add debouncing**
- Add debounce logic to autoplay triggers
- Pro: Prevents rapid restarts
- Con: Adds latency, doesn't solve root cause

**Option D: "Play once" flag in component**
- Track hasPlayed ref
- Modify autoplay.enabled to: computed(() => props.active && !hasPlayed.value)
- Set hasPlayed = true after first play
- Pro: Simple, prevents all restarts
- Con: Animation never replays even if intentional

Best approach: **Option A + D hybrid** - Manual control with play-once guard   │

│ Implementation strategy:

The useAnimation composable should return control methods. Let me verify what it returns by checking the first useAnimation call at line 186:
```typescript
const layoutObserver = useAnimation(theaterRef, {...})
```

It stores the return value, suggesting useAnimation DOES return something. The second and third calls (line 494, 516) don't store the return, suggesting they're fire-and-forget.

For the fix, we need to:
1. Store the return value of the stagger useAnimation call
2. Use the returned play() method
3. Create a watch on props.active that triggers play() once
4. Add hasPlayed ref to prevent replays

Code structure:
```typescript
const hasPlayedStagger = ref(false)
const staggerController = useAnimation(theaterRef, {
  autoplay: false, // DISABLE autoplay
  stagger: {...},
  animation: {...}
})

watch(() => props.active, (isActive) => {
  if (isActive && !hasPlayedStagger.value && staggerController.play) {
    staggerController.play()
    hasPlayedStagger.value = true
  }
})

│ Wait, I need to reconsider. Looking at line 494 again:
```typescript
useAnimation(theaterRef, {
  autoplay: {
    threshold: 0.25,
    enabled: computed(() => props.active)
  },
  ...
})
```

The `autoplay.threshold` is for intersection observer. But there's a critical issue: if autoplay has BOTH threshold AND enabled, they work together - animation plays when BOTH conditions are true.

But the real issue: when does it REPLAY? 

Looking at useAnimation composable behavior:
- It likely watches the `enabled` computed ref
- When enabled goes false → true, it replays
- When visibility crosses threshold while enabled is true, it replays

So if props.active toggles OR if scrolling causes visibility changes, the animation restarts.

The simplest fix: Remove the intersection observer entirely. Just use props.active as the sole trigger, but with a "play once" guard.   │

│ Final solution design:

**Primary fix**: Replace autoplay with manual control + play-once guard

Changes needed:
1. Add `hasPlayedStagger` ref
2. Store the return value of useAnimation
3. Remove autoplay config
4. Add watch on props.active
5. Call play() once when props.active becomes true

**Secondary consideration**: The chart animation (line 516) might have the same issue, but it doesn't use stagger so it's less noticeable. Should fix both for consistency.

**Code changes**:
```typescript
// Add refs
const hasPlayedStagger = ref(false)
const hasPlayedChart = ref(false)

// Store controllers
const staggerController = useAnimation(theaterRef, {
  autoplay: false, // Changed from autoplay config
  stagger: { children: '.metric-card', delay: 150, from: 'start' },
  animation: { keyframes: [...], duration: 500, easing: '...' }
})

const chartController = useAnimation(chartRef, {
  autoplay: false, // Changed from autoplay config
  animation: { preset: 'fadeIn', duration: 600, delay: 600, easing: '...' }
})

// Manual play control
watch(() => props.active, async (isActive) => {
  if (isActive) {
    if (!hasPlayedStagger.value && staggerController?.play) {
      await staggerController.play()
      hasPlayedStagger.value = true
    }
    if (!hasPlayedChart.value && chartController?.play) {
      await chartController.play()
      hasPlayedChart.value = true
    }
  }
}, { immediate: true })

│ Final verification and edge cases:

**What if useAnimation doesn't return play()?** 
- Need to check useAnimation.ts to confirm return signature
- If no play() method, fall back to simpler approach: remove threshold, keep autoplay.enabled with debounce

**What if props.active never becomes true?**
- watch with immediate: true will check on mount
- If false, animations stay paused (correct behavior)

**What about respectEnvironment?**
- Both animations have respectEnvironment: true
- This is preserved in the new approach
- Environment checks happen inside useAnimation, not in autoplay config

**Testing strategy**:
1. Test animation plays once on props.active = true
2. Test no replay when scrolling
3. Test no replay when props.active toggles true→false→true
4. Test reduced motion still works
5. Test responsive scaling still works (layoutObserver untouched)

The plan is complete. Ready to write the implementation document.   │
