│ Starting to analyze the v5 migration plan. The core principle is clear: phases should be self-contained, reusable modules instead of being defined across multiple files (workflow YAML + phase templates + subagent templates).

Current v4 architecture appears to have:
- Workflow YAMLs with subagent_matrix, gap_checks, subagent_outputs
- Phase templates (markdown files with mustache variables)
- Subagent templates (per-workflow, per-subagent prompt files)

V5 vision consolidates:
- Workflow YAML → Just phase sequence + inputs + checkpoints
- Phase YAML → Contains subagent_matrix, gap_checks, subagent configs
- No subagent templates → Prompts generated from phase YAML fields
- One generic executor → Replaces all phase templates

Key architectural shift: Moving from "configuration spread across files" to "phases as black boxes with clear interfaces".   │

│ Now examining the migration requirements more deeply. The v5 vision solves several problems with v4:

**Problem 1: Configuration Fragmentation**
- v4: To understand what "discovery" phase does, you must read:
  - workflow YAML (subagent_matrix)
  - phases/discovery.md template
  - subagents/code-researcher/investigation-workflow.md.tmpl
  - subagents/pattern-checker/investigation-workflow.md.tmpl
  - output_templates/patterns.json.tmpl

- v5: Everything in phases/discovery.yaml - single source of truth

**Problem 2: Template Explosion**
- v4: 51+ subagent template files (code-researcher × 10 workflows = 10 templates)
- v5: Subagent configs inline in phase YAML, prompts generated at runtime

**Problem 3: Workflow Coupling**
- v4: Workflows must know internal phase details (which subagents, what outputs)
- v5: Workflows just wire phases (inputs → phase → outputs), phases are black boxes

**Problem 4: Phase Reusability**
- v4: Hard to reuse "discovery" in different workflows because subagent matrix is in workflow
- v5: "discovery" phase works identically in any workflow, just receives different inputs

This is a significant architectural improvement.   │

│ Let me think about Nate's follow-up question in INTENDED_IMP_v5.md:

"shouldn't workflow config determine base directory? ex: base = '.claude/plans/' and then the + [feature-name]/ and then the phase folders in this."

Current v5 proposal has:
```yaml
base_dir: ".temp"  # Creates .temp/[feature-name]/
```

Nate is suggesting workflow should control the base path. This makes sense because:
- Different workflows might have different output needs
- Planning workflows → `.claude/plans/[feature-name]/`
- Investigation workflows → `.temp/[feature-name]/`
- Documentation workflows → `.claude/docs/[feature-name]/`

This is a valid enhancement to v5. The workflow should own:
1. base_dir (where outputs go)
2. Phase sequence
3. Input wiring
4. Checkpoints

Phase YAMLs would then use: `{{base_dir}}/{{feature_name}}/{{phase_output_dir}}/{{file}}`

I'll incorporate this into the implementation plan.   │

- Lines 15-42: subagent_matrix defines which agents run per phase
- Lines 44-50: subagent_outputs defines output filenames
- Lines 52-117: gap_checks define validation per phase
- Lines 119-147: checkpoints define user approval gates

**phases/discovery.md (v4):**
- Generic template with Mustache variables
- Lines 11-38: Loop through {{#subagents}} with {{task_agent_type}}, {{deliverable_filename}}
- Lines 48-71: Loop through {{#deliverables}} for output validation
- Lines 74-100: Gap check rendering from {{#gap_criteria}}
- Line 19: References "subagents/{{type}}/{{workflow}}.md.tmpl" for actual prompt

**subagents/registry.yaml:**
- Maps subagent names to metadata (task_agent_type, deliverable, template path)
- Line 12: `template: "subagents/code-researcher/{workflow}.md.tmpl"` means there's a file per workflow

This confirms the v4 pattern:
1. Workflow YAML has configuration data
2. Phase template renders instructions
3. Subagent templates contain actual prompts (51+ files)
4. Registry maps names to types

For v5, all of this should consolidate into phase YAML files.   │

│ Now I see the actual subagent template. The code-researcher has 4 different templates:
- investigation-workflow.md.tmpl
- new-feature.md.tmpl  
- refactoring.md.tmpl
- quick.md.tmpl

Each is customized for that workflow. The template includes:
- Task context (feature_name, scope, workflow)
- Input files to read from previous phase
- Output deliverable path and format
- Expected JSON schema

In v5, this would become a phase YAML entry:
```yaml
subagent_configs:
  code-researcher:
    task_agent_type: "code-researcher"
    responsibility: "Research codebase to identify patterns, similar implementations, dependencies"
    inputs_to_read:
      - from_workflow: true
        description: "problem.md from previous phase"
    outputs:
      - file: codebase.json
        schema: output_templates/codebase-analysis.json.tmpl
    scope_specific:
      frontend: "Focus on Vue components, composables, stores"
      backend: "Focus on API routes, Appwrite functions"
```

The prompt would be generated at runtime by combining these fields. This eliminates the need for 4 separate template files per subagent.   │

│ Now let me think through the implementation sequence. The v5 migration needs to happen incrementally to avoid breaking the existing system.

**Safe Migration Path:**

**Phase 1: Parallel Track Setup**
- Create phases-v5/ directory alongside existing phases/
- Create phase YAML schema
- Build one example phase YAML (discovery.yaml)
- Workflows stay unchanged (still use v4)

**Phase 2: Prompt Generator**
- Build lib/generate-prompt-from-yaml.sh
- Takes phase YAML + subagent name → generates prompt
- Test it generates equivalent prompts to existing templates
- No changes to execution yet

**Phase 3: Generic Executor Template**
- Create lib/phase-executor.md.tmpl
- Make it read phase YAML dynamically
- Test rendering with example phase
- Still doesn't affect live workflows

**Phase 4: Dual-Mode Scripts**
- Modify generate-workflow-instructions.sh to support --v5 flag
- If --v5: use phases-v5/ and phase-executor.md.tmpl
- Otherwise: use existing v4 system
- This allows A/B testing

**Phase 5: Phase YAML Migration**
- Convert all 26 phase templates → phase YAMLs
- Extract subagent configs from 51+ template files
- Move gap_checks from workflow YAMLs to phase YAMLs
- Keep v4 system working for fallback

**Phase 6: Workflow YAML Simplification**
- Create workflows-v5/ directory
- Remove subagent_matrix, gap_checks, subagent_outputs
- Add inputs[] wiring structure
- Add base_dir configuration
- Test with --v5 flag

**Phase 7: Cutover**
- Default to v5 (remove --v5 flag requirement)
- Move workflows-v5/ → workflows/
- Move phases-v5/ → phases/
- Archive old templates to .archives/

**Phase 8: Cleanup**
- Delete subagents/ directory (51+ templates)
- Delete old phase .md templates
- Delete old workflow YAMLs
- Update documentation

This incremental approach allows testing at each step without breaking production.   │

│ Wait, I need to reconsider Phase 4. Adding a --v5 flag to existing scripts might be complex.

**Better approach:** Create entirely new scripts for v5:
- generate-workflow-v5.sh (new entry point)
- fetch-phase-v5.sh (progressive disclosure)
- lib/phase-executor-v5.sh (execution logic)

This allows:
1. v4 and v5 to coexist completely independently
2. Easy comparison between v4 and v5 outputs
3. No risk of breaking existing workflows
4. Clean cutover when ready (rename scripts)

The migration steps would be:
1. Build v5 infrastructure (scripts, libs, phase-executor template)
2. Create one complete example (investigation-workflow in v5)
3. Test v5 vs v4 output equivalence
4. Migrate remaining workflows one by one
5. When all workflows work in v5, deprecate v4
6. Rename v5 scripts to primary scripts
7. Delete v4 artifacts

This is safer and clearer.   │

│ Now thinking about the phase YAML schema in detail. Each phase YAML needs:

**Required fields:**
- `name`: string (phase identifier)
- `purpose`: string (what this phase does)
- `subagents`: object with always[] and conditional{} arrays
- `subagent_configs`: object mapping subagent names to configs
- `gap_checks`: object with criteria[] and on_failure[] arrays
- `provides`: array of string identifiers for what phase outputs

**Subagent config structure:**
- `task_agent_type`: string (matches Task tool agent types)
- `responsibility`: string (what this subagent does - becomes core of prompt)
- `outputs`: array of {file, schema, required, description}
- `inputs_to_read`: array describing what context files to read
- `instructions`: string (step-by-step guidance for subagent)
- `scope_specific`: object with frontend/backend/both keys containing scope-specific guidance
- `model`: optional string (haiku/sonnet/opus)
- `thoroughness`: optional string (quick/medium/very thorough)

**Example:**
```yaml
name: codebase-investigation
purpose: "Scan codebase for patterns, dependencies, and integration points"

subagents:
  always:
    - code-researcher
  conditional: {}

subagent_configs:
  code-researcher:
    task_agent_type: "code-researcher"
    model: "sonnet"

        description: "Comprehensive codebase analysis with patterns and dependencies"
    
    instructions: |
      1. Read the problem.md to understand what to search for
      2. Search for existing patterns using multiple strategies
      3. Identify similar implementations and rate reusability
      4. Map dependencies (internal and external)
      5. Document architectural conventions
      6. Output findings in structured JSON format
    
    scope_specific:
      frontend: |
        Search locations: src/components/, src/composables/, src/stores/
        Look for: Vue component patterns, Tailwind usage, Nanostore integration
        Focus on: Client-side state management, SSR safety, reactive patterns
      backend: |
        Search locations: functions/, src/pages/api/
        Look for: Appwrite integration patterns, API route patterns, auth flows
        Focus on: Server-side data handling, permission checks, schema validation
      both: |
        Trace full-stack flows: frontend → API routes → Appwrite
        Look for: Data transformation patterns, type sharing, API contracts

gap_checks:
  criteria:
    - "At least 5 patterns identified with file:line citations"
    - "Dependencies mapped (internal and external)"
    - "Integration points documented"
    - "All file paths verified to exist (no hallucination)"
    - "Reusability ratings provided (REUSE/EXTEND/CREATE)"
  on_failure:
    - "Retry with broader search scope"
    - "Continue with current findings"
    - "Abort workflow"

provides:
  - codebase_patterns
  - similar_implementations
  - dependency_map
  - architectural_conventions
```

│ Now thinking about workflow YAML schema for v5. The workflow should be dramatically simpler:

**Required fields:**
- `name`: string
- `description`: string
- `estimated_time`: string
- `estimated_tokens`: string
- `base_dir`: string (e.g., ".temp", ".claude/plans")
- `phases`: array of phase execution configs
- `checkpoints`: array of user approval gates
- `default_scope`: string (template variable for user-provided scope)

**Phase execution config:**
```yaml
- name: phase-id  # References phases/{name}.yaml
  scope: "default" | "{{workflow_scope}}" | "frontend" | "backend"
  inputs:
    - from: previous-phase-id
      files: [filename1, filename2]
      context_description: "What these files contain"
```

**Example:**
```yaml
name: investigation-workflow
description: "Balanced investigation with codebase + external research"
estimated_time: 20-40 minutes
estimated_tokens: 20K-60K

# Determines output location
base_dir: ".temp"  # Creates .temp/[feature-name]/

# Phase sequence with input wiring
phases:
  - name: problem-understanding
    scope: default
    inputs: []  # First phase, no inputs

  - name: codebase-investigation
    scope: "{{workflow_scope}}"  # Use user-provided --frontend/--backend
    inputs:
      - from: problem-understanding
        files: [problem.md, constraints.json]
        context_description: "Problem definition to focus codebase research"

  - name: external-research
    scope: default
    inputs:
      - from: problem-understanding
        files: [problem.md]
      - from: codebase-investigation
        files: [codebase-analysis.json]
        context_description: "Codebase patterns to compare against best practices"

  - name: solution-synthesis

      - from: codebase-investigation
        files: [codebase-analysis.json]
      - from: external-research
        files: [best-practices.md]
        context_description: "All research to synthesize approaches"

  - name: introspection
    scope: default
    inputs:
      - from: solution-synthesis
        files: [approaches.json]
        context_description: "Approaches with assumptions to validate"

  - name: approach-refinement
    scope: default
    inputs:
      - from: introspection
        files: [assumptions-validated.json, approaches-revised.json]

# User approval gates
checkpoints:
  - after: problem-understanding
    prompt: "Confirm problem understanding before research"
    show_files: []  # File names only, not full paths
    options:
      - "Proceed to research"
      - "Refine problem statement"
      - "Abort"

  - after: introspection
    prompt: "Review validated assumptions and revised approaches"
    show_files:
      - "approaches.json"
      - "assumptions-validated.json"
      - "approaches-revised.json"
    options:
      - "Continue with revised approach"
      - "Need more introspection"
      - "Abort"

default_scope: "{{user_provided_scope}}"
```

Notice what's GONE:
- ❌ subagent_matrix (moved to phase YAMLs)
- ❌ subagent_outputs (moved to phase YAMLs)
- ❌ gap_checks (moved to phase YAMLs)
- ❌ template field (using generic phase-executor now)

│ Now thinking about the prompt generation algorithm. This is critical - it replaces 51+ template files.

**Prompt Generation Function:**
```bash
generate_subagent_prompt() {
  local phase_yaml="$1"
  local subagent_name="$2"
  local feature_name="$3"
  local scope="$4"
  local workflow_name="$5"
  local input_files_json="$6"  # JSON array of context files
  
  # Extract subagent config from phase YAML
  local responsibility=$(yq ".subagent_configs.$subagent_name.responsibility" "$phase_yaml")
  local instructions=$(yq ".subagent_configs.$subagent_name.instructions" "$phase_yaml")
  local scope_guidance=$(yq ".subagent_configs.$subagent_name.scope_specific.$scope" "$phase_yaml")
  local output_schema=$(yq ".subagent_configs.$subagent_name.outputs[0].schema" "$phase_yaml")
  local output_file=$(yq ".subagent_configs.$subagent_name.outputs[0].file" "$phase_yaml")
  
  # Build prompt
  cat <<EOF
# Task Context for $subagent_name

You are supporting the $workflow_name workflow for **$feature_name**.

**Phase:** $(yq '.name' "$phase_yaml")
**Scope:** $scope

## Your Task

$responsibility

## Input Context

$(format_input_files "$input_files_json")

## Instructions

$instructions

## Scope-Specific Focus

$scope_guidance

## Output Deliverable

Write findings to: \`.temp/$feature_name/phase-X/$(basename "$output_file")\`

### Expected Format

$(cat "$output_schema")

## Success Criteria

- All required fields populated
- File paths include line numbers (file:line)
- JSON is valid and matches schema
- Confidence ratings provided where applicable
EOF
}
```

This function:
1. Reads phase YAML
2. Extracts relevant config sections
3. Formats input file list
4. Embeds output schema
5. Generates cohesive prompt

The prompt is assembled at runtime, not stored in template files. This means:
- One prompt generator handles ALL subagents
- Workflow variations become scope_specific sections in YAML
- Changes require editing YAML, not template files
- No template duplication   │

**lib/phase-executor.md.tmpl structure:**

```markdown
# Phase {{phase_number}}: {{phase_name}}

## Purpose
{{phase_purpose}}

## Available Context
{{#phase_inputs}}
From phase "{{from_phase}}":

## Execution

### Main Agent Responsibilities
{{execution_notes}}

### Subagents to Spawn
{{#subagents}}
#### {{index}}. {{subagent_name}}

**Configuration:**
- Agent type: {{task_agent_type}}
- Model: {{model}}
- Thoroughness: {{thoroughness}}

**Task:**
{{responsibility}}

**Context files to read:**
{{#context_files}}
- {{path}} - {{description}}
{{/context_files}}

**Expected output:**
- File: {{output_file}}
- Schema: {{schema_path}}
- Required: {{required}}

**Invoke Task tool:**
[Generated prompt appears here]

{{/subagents}}

### Wait for Completion
Monitor {{subagent_count}} subagent(s) until complete.

### Validate Outputs
{{#subagent_outputs}}
Read {{output_file}} and verify:
- File exists
- Valid {{file_format}}
- Matches schema
- Contains required fields
{{/subagent_outputs}}

**Deliverables:**
{{#deliverables}}
- {{filepath}} - {{description}}
{{/deliverables}}

**Provides for next phases:**
{{#provides}}
- {{data_item}}
{{/provides}}

The key insight: This template is DATA-DRIVEN, not INSTRUCTION-DRIVEN.

Instead of hardcoded instructions, it renders based on:
- Phase YAML data
- Workflow input wiring
- Subagent configs
- Gap checks
- Checkpoints

It's generic because phase YAMLs provide all the specifics.   │

│ Now let me think about potential challenges and how to address them:

**Challenge 1: Scope-specific content**
v4 uses Mustache conditionals: {{#if_frontend}}...{{/if_frontend}}
v5 uses scope_specific object with keys: frontend/backend/both

Migration: Need to extract conditional blocks from templates and reorganize into scope_specific object in YAML.

**Challenge 2: Complex template logic**
Some phase templates might have complex loops, nested conditionals, or dynamic sections.

Solution: The generic executor must handle variable structures. Use Mustache's {{#array}} and {{^empty}} patterns.

**Challenge 3: Workflow-specific variations**
code-researcher has different prompts for investigation vs debugging vs refactoring.

Solution: These differences are usually scope-specific guidance. Consolidate into one config with rich scope_specific sections.

**Challenge 4: Progressive disclosure**
Current system uses fetch-phase-details.sh to get one phase at a time.

Solution: fetch-phase-v5.sh works similarly but:
1. Loads workflow YAML to get phase sequence + inputs
2. Loads phase YAML for the requested phase
3. Renders phase-executor.md.tmpl with merged data
4. Outputs instructions

**Challenge 5: Maintaining backwards compatibility**
During migration, both systems must work.

Solution: Keep v4 completely intact in separate directories:
- phases/ (v4) vs phases-v5/ (new)
- workflows/ (v4) vs workflows-v5/ (new)
- generate-workflow-instructions.sh (v4) vs generate-workflow-v5.sh (new)

When v5 is validated, rename and delete v4 artifacts.

**Challenge 6: Testing equivalence**
Need to verify v5 produces equivalent instructions to v4.

Solution: Run both systems with same inputs, diff the outputs, verify semantic equivalence.   │

│ Now synthesizing the complete implementation plan with task breakdown:

**IMPLEMENTATION PLAN - Workflow System v5 Migration**

**Phase 1: Foundation (Schema + Tools)**
Tasks:
1. Create YAML schemas (phase-schema.yaml, workflow-schema.yaml)
2. Create lib/prompt-generator.sh (generates prompts from YAML)
3. Create lib/phase-executor.md.tmpl (generic template)
4. Create validation scripts (validate-phase-yaml.sh, validate-workflow-yaml.sh)
5. Document new architecture in ARCHITECTURE_v5.md

**Phase 2: Example Implementation**
Tasks:
1. Create phases-v5/codebase-investigation.yaml (first example)
   - Extract code-researcher config from subagent templates
   - Move gap_checks from workflow YAML
   - Add provides[] interface
2. Create workflows-v5/investigation-workflow.yaml
   - Remove subagent_matrix, gap_checks, outputs
   - Add inputs[] wiring
   - Add base_dir
3. Create generate-workflow-v5.sh (new entry point)
4. Create fetch-phase-v5.sh (progressive disclosure)
5. Test: Run investigation-workflow in v5, compare to v4 output

**Phase 3: Subagent Config Migration**
Tasks:
1. For each of 26 subagents in registry:
   - Read all workflow-specific templates (investigation, new-feature, debugging, etc.)
   - Extract common responsibility
   - Extract workflow-specific variations → scope_specific
   - Extract instructions
   - Document in migration spreadsheet
2. Create subagent-config-templates/ with reusable configs
3. Validate no information lost in consolidation

**Phase 4: Phase YAML Creation (Batch 1: Common Phases)**
Convert these phases to YAML:
1. problem-understanding.yaml
2. codebase-investigation.yaml (already done in Phase 2)
3. requirements.yaml
4. design.yaml
5. synthesis.yaml

For each:
- Extract subagent_matrix from workflows using this phase
- Move gap_checks from workflow YAMLs
- Create subagent_configs from template files
- Define provides[] interface
- Test rendering with phase-executor

**Phase 5: Phase YAML Creation (Batch 2: Workflow-Specific Phases)**
Convert these phases to YAML:
1. external-research.yaml
2. solution-synthesis.yaml
3. introspection.yaml
4. approach-refinement.yaml
5. bug-investigation.yaml
6. root-cause-analysis.yaml
7. fix-planning.yaml
8. (... remaining 19 phases)

**Phase 6: Workflow YAML Migration**
Convert all 10 workflows to v5 format:
1. investigation-workflow.yaml (already done)
2. new-feature-plan.yaml
3. debugging-plan.yaml
4. refactoring-plan.yaml
5. improving-plan.yaml
6. quick-plan.yaml
7. plan-writing-workflow.yaml
8. quick-investigation.yaml
9. (... remaining workflows)

For each:
- Add base_dir configuration
- Convert phase list to phase execution configs
- Add inputs[] wiring
- Remove v4-specific fields

**Phase 7: Script Integration**
Tasks:
1. Update generate-workflow-v5.sh to handle all workflows
2. Update fetch-phase-v5.sh for progressive disclosure
3. Create workflow-composer.sh (for phase reuse)
4. Update lib/ functions for v5 data structures
5. Create migration guide (v4 → v5 for users)

**Phase 8: Testing & Validation**
Tasks:
1. Run all 10 workflows in v5
2. Compare outputs to v4 (semantic equivalence)
3. Test scope variations (--frontend, --backend, --both)
4. Test checkpoint behavior
5. Test gap check flows
6. Test progressive disclosure
7. Performance testing (token usage comparison)

**Phase 9: Documentation**
Tasks:
1. Update SKILL.md with v5 usage
2. Update WORKFLOW_CREATION_GUIDE.md for v5
3. Create PHASE_CREATION_GUIDE.md
4. Create MIGRATION_GUIDE_v4_to_v5.md
5. Archive v4 docs to .archives/

**Phase 10: Cutover**
Tasks:
1. Rename generate-workflow-v5.sh → generate-workflow-instructions.sh
2. Move workflows-v5/ → workflows/
3. Move phases-v5/ → phases/
4. Archive v4 to .archives/v4/
5. Delete subagents/ directory (51+ templates)
6. Update all references in parent project

**Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All 10 workflows work in v5
- ✅ Output equivalence to v4 verified
- ✅ Progressive disclosure works
- ✅ Phase YAMLs are complete (26 phases)
- ✅ Workflow YAMLs are simplified (10 workflows)
- ✅ No template files (51+ deleted)
- ✅ Documentation complete
- ✅ Tests pass

**Estimated Effort:**
- Phase 1-2: 8-12 hours (foundation + example)
- Phase 3-5: 20-30 hours (subagent + phase migration)
- Phase 6-7: 10-15 hours (workflow migration + scripts)
- Phase 8-10: 8-12 hours (testing + docs + cutover)
- **Total: 46-69 hours** (roughly 6-9 working days)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Keep v4 intact until v5 fully validated
- Incremental migration (one workflow at a time)
- Comparison testing at each step
- Rollback plan (restore v4 from .archives/)

This plan addresses Nate's follow-up about base_dir and maintains the core v5 vision of phase-centric architecture.   │

│ Final thought - let me consider the key benefits this migration delivers and ensure they're clear:

**Benefits of v5 Architecture:**

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - v4: Phase behavior scattered across workflow YAML, phase template, 4+ subagent templates
   - v5: Everything in one phase YAML file
   - Benefit: Understanding/modifying a phase requires reading ONE file

2. **Reusability**
   - v4: Can't easily reuse "discovery" in new workflow without duplicating templates
   - v5: Phase YAML works in ANY workflow, just wire inputs differently
   - Benefit: Create new workflows by composing existing phases

3. **Maintainability**
   - v4: Change code-researcher behavior → edit 4+ template files
   - v5: Edit one subagent_config in phase YAML
   - Benefit: Changes are localized, no template duplication

4. **Workflow Clarity**
   - v4: Workflow YAML has 150 lines of subagent/gap config
   - v5: Workflow YAML has ~50 lines of pure coordination
   - Benefit: Workflow intent is immediately clear

5. **No Template Explosion**
   - v4: 26 phases × 2 subagents × 4 workflows = 200+ potential templates
   - v5: 26 phase YAMLs + 1 generic executor = 27 files
   - Benefit: Massive reduction in file count

6. **Generated Prompts**
   - v4: Edit template files manually
   - v5: Prompts generated from structured YAML data
   - Benefit: Consistency, validation, easier to change

7. **Clear Interfaces**
   - v4: Phases implicitly produce outputs
   - v5: Phases declare `provides[]` explicitly
   - Benefit: Workflow wiring is type-safe, discoverable

8. **Base Directory Control**
   - v4: Output paths hardcoded in templates
   - v5: Workflow controls base_dir
   - Benefit: Different workflows can output to different locations (.temp vs .claude/plans)

The migration delivers significant architectural improvements that compound over time as the system grows.

I'm now ready to present the complete implementation plan.   │
