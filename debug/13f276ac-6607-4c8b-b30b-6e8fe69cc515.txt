The changes eliminate 11 platform-specific card components (BlueskyCard, FbPageCard, FbUserCard, GoogleCard, InstagramCard, LinkedInCard, MastodonCard, PinterestCard, ThreadsCard, TikTokCard, YouTubeCard) and replace them with a unified GenericProviderCard that uses configuration from providerCards.ts.

│ First potential issue: In GenericProviderCard.vue, line 2 uses `v-bind="$props"` to pass all props to BaseProviderCard. This includes the `platform` prop. However, BaseProviderCard expects `platformType`, not `platform`. Looking at line 2, it explicitly passes `:platform-type="config.platformType"`, which correctly maps platform → platformType. This is good, but `platform` will also be passed through $props. This creates a redundant/unknown prop warning. Need to verify if this causes issues.   │

│ Second potential issue: BaseProviderCard.vue has a retry mechanism with computedAsync. The retryLoad function (line 220-226) sets error to undefined, resets retryCount, sets loading to true, and calls fetchAccountData(). However, there's a problem: computedAsync is already managing the loading state and the async computation. When retryLoad manually calls fetchAccountData(), it doesn't actually trigger the computedAsync to re-evaluate. The accountData computed is only re-evaluated when its dependencies change. This means the manual retry button might not work correctly.   │

│ Wait, I need to reconsider. The old platform cards used `defineModel<boolean>("selected")` which creates a v-model prop. But the old MultiProviderCard listened to @selected (not @update:selected). Since v-model emits "update:selected", the @selected listener would never fire in the old code either. This means the selection feature was ALREADY broken in main branch! The new code tries to fix it by using @update:selected, but incorrectly passes account instead of handling the boolean value. This is a pre-existing bug that the refactor attempted to fix but introduced a new bug.   │

│ Now analyzing the BaseProviderCard retry mechanism. In BaseProviderCard.vue lines 214-218, accountData is a computedAsync that calls fetchAccountData. The retryLoad function (lines 220-226) manually calls fetchAccountData() but this doesn't trigger the computedAsync to re-evaluate. computedAsync only re-evaluates when its dependencies change (mounted.value or props.accountId). Simply calling fetchAccountData() won't update accountData.value. The retry button will not work as intended.   │

│ Summary of findings: (1) CRITICAL BUG: Three files incorrectly handle v-model:selected events - MultiProviderCard, CompletionView, ConnectAccountsStep all pass account objects to handlers but v-model emits booleans. This will cause runtime errors. (2) MAJOR BUG: BaseProviderCard retry mechanism won't work - retryLoad() manually calls fetchAccountData() but doesn't trigger computedAsync re-evaluation. (3) MINOR ISSUE: GenericProviderCard passes unknown "platform" prop to BaseProviderCard causing Vue warnings. (4) TypeScript errors are pre-existing, not from this branch. The refactor has serious bugs that will break account selection functionality.   │
