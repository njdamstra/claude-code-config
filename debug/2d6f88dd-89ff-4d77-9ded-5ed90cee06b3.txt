[GMCPT] [1762664350723] Starting: gemini "-p" "Create a Node.js script that will update all plugin files in the useAnimation/plugins directory to remove inline type definitions and import them from ../types instead.

The script should:
1. For each plugin file (staggerPlugin.ts, cssVarsPlugin.ts, autoplayPlugin.ts, etc.)
2. Find the exported interface/type definitions at the top of the file
3. Remove those definitions
4. Update the import statement to include those types from '../types'

Example transformation for staggerPlugin.ts:

BEFORE:
```typescript
import { ref, reactive } from 'vue'
import type { AnimationPlugin, AnimationContext, PluginSystem, UseAnimationStaggerOptions } from '../types'

export interface StaggerPluginOptions extends UseAnimationStaggerOptions {
  preset?: string
  keyframes?: any
}

export interface StaggerSystem extends PluginSystem {
  elements: Ref<HTMLElement[]>
}
```

AFTER:
```typescript
import { ref, reactive } from 'vue'
import type {
  AnimationPlugin,
  AnimationContext,
  UseAnimationStaggerOptions,
  StaggerPluginOptions,
  StaggerSystem
} from '../types'
```

The script should handle all these plugins:
- staggerPlugin.ts
- cssVarsPlugin.ts  
- autoplayPlugin.ts
- timelinePlugin.ts
- sequencePlugin.ts
- motionPathPlugin.ts
- svgPlugin.ts
- gridPlugin.ts
- progressPlugin.ts
- enterExitPlugin.ts
- performancePlugin.ts
- virtualScrollPlugin.ts
- batchPlugin.ts
- lazyInitPlugin.ts
- relationshipsPlugin.ts
- webAnimationPlugin.ts

Output a complete, working Node.js script."
