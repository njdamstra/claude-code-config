│ Starting analysis of Google OAuth optimization problem. The user wants:
1. Returning users: Quick account selection without re-consent
2. New users: Minimal permissions for sign-up only
3. Separate flows: Sign-up/sign-in vs workflow account connection

First, I need to understand what causes re-consent. Key hypothesis: The consent screen appearing every time suggests either:
- We're requesting approval_prompt=force
- We're using offline access without proper refresh tokens
- The scopes are too broad or changing between sessions
- The OAuth app isn't verified by Google

Let me map out the investigation steps needed.   │

│ The investigation should follow this order:

**Phase 1: Codebase Analysis**
- Find OAuthManager function and examine current scopes
- Check if there's differentiation between sign-up vs workflow scopes
- Look for parameters like approval_prompt, access_type, prompt
- Check how refresh tokens are handled

**Phase 2: External Research** 
- Google OAuth best practices for "one-tap" sign-in
- Incremental authorization patterns
- Minimum scopes needed for authentication only
- Difference between consent modes (select_account, consent, none)

**Phase 3: Solution Design**
- Compare what we're doing vs what we should do
- Design minimal scope set for sign-up
- Design incremental auth for workflow connections

Let me start Phase 1 by exploring the codebase for OAuthManager.   │

│ **Critical Finding from Codebase Analysis:**

The root cause of the re-consent problem is on line 53 of YouTubeClient.ts:
```typescript
prompt: "consent",  // ← FORCES consent screen every time
```

Current scope configuration requests ALL 11 scopes upfront (from providers.json):
- 8 YouTube-specific scopes (channel memberships, upload, analytics, partner)
- 3 basic scopes (profile, email, openid)

**Key Issues:**
1. `prompt: "consent"` forces permission review for ALL users (new and returning)
2. No scope separation between sign-up (needs only email/profile) and workflow connection (needs YouTube scopes)
3. Requesting YouTube scopes during sign-up is excessive - only need basic profile/email

**What should happen:**
- Sign-up/sign-in: Only request `openid`, `email`, `profile` scopes
- Returning users: Use `prompt: "select_account"` or `prompt: "none"` 
- Workflow connection: Request full YouTube scopes when user connects account for workflows

This aligns with incremental authorization pattern. Let me verify this approach with external research.   │

│ **Solution Design for Minimal Sign-Up Scopes:**

Based on research and codebase analysis, here's the implementation strategy:

**Current State (providers.json line 71):**
- 11 scopes requested upfront during sign-up
- Includes all YouTube scopes even when user just wants to sign in

**Target State:**
- Sign-up/sign-in: Only `openid`, `email`, `profile` (3 scopes)
- Workflow connection: All YouTube scopes when user explicitly connects account

**Implementation Approach:**

1. **Create two scope configurations:**
   - `authScopes`: Minimal for authentication only
   - `workflowScopes`: Full YouTube scopes for account connection

2. **Modify providers.json:**
   - Add `authScopes` field: `["openid", "email", "profile"]`
   - Keep `scope` field for workflow: All current YouTube scopes

3. **Update GoogleOAuthManager.ts logic:**
   - Check `registration` flag in state
   - If registration=true → use `authScopes`
   - If registration=false → use `scope` (workflow scopes)

4. **Schema changes needed:**
   - OAuthProvider interface needs optional `authScopes` field
   - Validation in oAuthProvider.ts schema

This way users get fast sign-up, and only request YouTube permissions when they actually connect account for workflows.   │

│ **Solution Design for One-Tap Returning User Experience:**

**Current Problem (YouTubeClient.ts line 53):**
```typescript
prompt: "consent",  // Forces consent every time
```

**Research Finding:**
- Omitting `prompt` parameter = Google uses cached consent for returning users
- Same scopes + no prompt = quick account selection, no permission review

**Target Behavior:**
- New users: See consent screen (unavoidable, first authorization)
- Returning users: Quick account selection → logged in
- Scope changes: Show consent only if requesting new scopes

**Implementation Options:**

**Option A: Always omit prompt (RECOMMENDED)**
```typescript
async getLoginUrl(state: string): Promise<string> {
  const url = this.authClient.generateAuthUrl({
    access_type: "offline",
    // NO prompt parameter - let Google decide
    scope: this.provider.scope,
    state,
    redirectUri: getBaseRedirectUrl(),
    response_type: "code",
  });
  return url;
}
```

**Option B: Conditional prompt based on registration flag**
```typescript
const decodedState = OAuthHelper.verifyState(state);
const isRegistration = decodedState?.registration;

const url = this.authClient.generateAuthUrl({
  access_type: "offline",
  prompt: isRegistration ? undefined : "select_account",
  // registration=true → no prompt (Google caches)
  // registration=false → select_account (workflow)
  ...
});
```

**Recommendation:** Option A is simpler and aligns with Google best practices. Only use `prompt: "consent"` for development/testing or when explicitly requesting new scopes.   │

│ **Edge Cases and Considerations:**

**Edge Case 1: Refresh Token Generation**
- Research says: Refresh token only returned on FIRST authorization
- Current code uses `access_type: "offline"` (correct)
- Problem: If user granted minimal scopes initially, then we request YouTube scopes later, will we get a new refresh token?

**Answer:** Yes, each scope set can have its own refresh token. When requesting new scopes, Google returns a new refresh token if `access_type: "offline"` is used.

**Edge Case 2: User Already Signed Up with Full Scopes**
- Existing users already granted all 11 scopes
- If we change to minimal scopes, will they need to re-authorize?

**Answer:** No. Google caches granted scopes. If we request fewer scopes than already granted, it's automatic. Only requesting NEW scopes triggers consent.

**Edge Case 3: Multiple OAuth Accounts**
- User signs up with Google (minimal scopes)
- Later connects Google account for YouTube workflows (full scopes)
- Are these two separate OAuth account records?

**Current Implementation:** No - the code reuses existing OAuth account. In GoogleOAuthManager.ts line 132:

const existingOAuth = await this.findOAuthAccount('google', uniqueId, email);
```

**Decision:** Should we create separate records for different scope sets? Or update existing record with expanded scopes?

**Recommendation:** Update existing record. Store all granted scopes in a JSON array, append new scopes when user authorizes workflows.   │

│ **Scope Storage Verification:**

The OAuthAccount schema (line 45-48) already supports scope storage:
```typescript
scope: z
  .string()
  .max(1024, "Maximum length of 1024 characters exceeded")
  .nullish(),
```

This is perfect - scopes are stored as space-separated string (OAuth standard). When updating OAuth account with new scopes, we can:
1. Merge existing scopes with new scopes
2. Store combined set in `scope` field
3. Pass combined scopes when refreshing tokens

**No schema changes needed** - existing structure supports incremental authorization.

**Implementation Steps Summary:**

1. **Add `authScopes` to providers.json** for Google provider
2. **Modify YouTubeClient.ts** to remove `prompt: "consent"`
3. **Update scope selection logic** in GoogleOAuthManager or BaseOAuthManager:
   - If registration=true → use authScopes (minimal)
   - If registration=false → use scope (full workflow scopes)
4. **Update scope merging** when linking account:
   - Combine existing granted scopes with new requested scopes
   - Store in OAuthAccount.scope field

Let me now create final implementation recommendations.   │

│ **Final Implementation Plan:**

The solution addresses both user concerns through incremental authorization:

**Problem 1 Solution: One-Tap for Returning Users**
- Remove `prompt: "consent"` from YouTubeClient.ts line 53
- Google caches consent and shows only account selection on return visits

**Problem 2 Solution: Minimal Sign-Up Permissions**
- Add `authScopes` field to providers.json for Google
- Use minimal scopes for registration: `["openid", "email", "profile"]`
- Request YouTube scopes only when user explicitly connects account for workflows

**Files to Modify:**
1. `providers.json` - Add authScopes field
2. `YouTubeClient.ts` - Remove prompt parameter
3. `BaseOAuthManager.ts` - Add scope selection logic based on registration flag
4. `oAuthProvider.ts` - Update schema to include optional authScopes

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Fast sign-up: Only 3 scopes vs 11 scopes
- ✅ One-tap returning users: No re-consent
- ✅ Compliance: Request least privilege access
- ✅ Better UX: Users understand why they're granting permissions

**Migration:** Existing users with full scopes won't be affected - Google caches granted permissions.   │
