│ Analyzing question 1: "In total including all of this animation's children, is there only 1 instance of useAnimation composable?"

Let me trace through the component hierarchy:

**AiConductorGraphicV2** (line 168):
- Uses `useAnimation(conductorRef, {...})` for environment detection (battery, FPS, reduced motion)

**AnimatedFloatingElement** (line 63):
- Uses `useAnimation(elementRef, {...})` for preset animations (fadeIn, etc.)

**SocialPathway** (line 64):
- Uses `useAnimation(pathwayRef, {...})` for environment detection with event bus

**PlatformIconSequence** (line 73):
- Uses `useAnimation(sequenceRef, {...})` for environment detection with event bus

**AiOrb** - NO useAnimation (pure CSS keyframe animations)
**SparkAnimation** - NO useAnimation (uses VueUse Motion's useAnimate)
**SocialIcon** - NO useAnimation (uses VueUse Motion's useAnimate)
**SocialPostCard** - NO useAnimation (uses VueUse Motion's useAnimate)

ANSWER: No, there are 4 instances of useAnimation:
1. AiConductorGraphicV2
2. AnimatedFloatingElement
3. SocialPathway
4. PlatformIconSequence   │

│ Analyzing question 2: "For each of the children components, are there animated qualities CSS animation driven?"

Let me check each child component for CSS animations:

**AiOrb** (line 56-74):
- YES - Pure CSS keyframe animation: `@keyframes orb-pulse`
- Animation properties: `transform: scale()`, `box-shadow`
- Controlled via `animation-play-state: paused/running`

**SocialPathway**:
- NO CSS animations - uses event-driven JavaScript timing with setTimeout
- Children handle their own animations (see below)

**SparkAnimation** (line 23-28):
- NO CSS animations - uses VueUse Motion's `useAnimate` with Web Animations API
- Keyframes defined in JS, executed via WAAPI

**SocialIcon** (line 73-86):
- NO CSS animations for the main animation
- Uses VueUse Motion's `useAnimate` for pulse effect
- Has CSS transition for hover/glow effects only

**SocialPostCard** (line 71-76):
- NO CSS animations for the main animation
- Uses VueUse Motion's `useAnimate` for float-in/float-out effect
- Keyframes defined in JS

**PlatformIconSequence** (line 387-446):
- YES - Multiple CSS keyframe animations:
  - `@keyframes icon-pop-in` (line 387)
  - `@keyframes pulse-action` (line 398)
  - `@keyframes glow-pulse` (line 424)
  - `@keyframes particle-glow` (line 442)
- Also uses VueUse Motion's `useAnimate` for floating animation (line 192-196)

ANSWER: Mixed approach
- Pure CSS: AiOrb (1/4 direct children)
- Hybrid CSS + WAAPI: PlatformIconSequence (1/4 direct children)
- Pure WAAPI/JS: SocialPathway and all its grandchildren (SparkAnimation, SocialIcon, SocialPostCard)   │

│ Analyzing question 3: "How many instances of AnimatedFloatingElement are there, is there only one?"

Looking at AiConductorGraphicV2.vue template (line 3-61):

**AnimatedFloatingElement usage:**
- Line 3-61: ONE instance wrapping the entire conductor graphic
- It's used as a teleported wrapper that handles enter/exit animations
- The ref is `floatingElementRef` (line 134)

Checking children:
- AiOrb: No AnimatedFloatingElement
- SocialPathway: No AnimatedFloatingElement
- PlatformIconSequence: No AnimatedFloatingElement
- SparkAnimation: No AnimatedFloatingElement
- SocialIcon: No AnimatedFloatingElement
- SocialPostCard: No AnimatedFloatingElement

ANSWER: Yes, there is exactly ONE instance of AnimatedFloatingElement in the entire component tree. It wraps the conductor graphic and handles teleportation + initial enter/exit animations.   │

│ Analyzing question 4: "Would it be a good idea to create an instance of useAnimation in its children ONLY using the cssAnimationPlugin (pros and cons)?"

Current situation:
- AiOrb: Pure CSS @keyframes, no useAnimation
- SparkAnimation: VueUse Motion's useAnimate (WAAPI)
- SocialIcon: VueUse Motion's useAnimate (WAAPI)
- SocialPostCard: VueUse Motion's useAnimate (WAAPI)
- PlatformIconSequence: Both CSS @keyframes + VueUse Motion's useAnimate

Proposal: Add useAnimation with cssAnimationPlugin to components that already use CSS animations

**PROS:**
1. **Unified environment detection** - All components would benefit from battery/FPS/reduced motion checks from useAnimation
2. **Event bus consistency** - Components could emit animation events through the conductor event bus
3. **Quality degradation** - CSS animations could automatically degrade based on performance metrics
4. **Centralized control** - Parent could pause/resume all child animations through the environment system
5. **Better orchestration** - All animations participate in the same lifecycle management

**CONS:**
1. **Overhead** - Each component would create another useAnimation instance (already have 4 instances, would add 3-4 more)
2. **Redundancy** - AiOrb already has CSS animations working perfectly with animation-play-state control
3. **Complexity** - cssAnimationPlugin is designed for managing CSS custom properties, not controlling animation-play-state
4. **Not a good fit** - SparkAnimation/SocialIcon/SocialPostCard use WAAPI via VueUse Motion, not CSS @keyframes
5. **Limited benefit** - These components already have environment checks through parent's event bus (conductor bus)
6. **Migration effort** - Would need to refactor working code with minimal benefit

**BETTER ALTERNATIVE:**
- Keep current architecture where parent (AiConductorGraphicV2) has useAnimation for environment detection
- Parent broadcasts environment state changes via event bus
- Children listen to bus and adapt (already happening)
- Use cssAnimationPlugin ONLY if you need to dynamically generate CSS custom properties for animations   │

│ Analyzing question 5: "Are there other plugins that would be beneficial to use in AiConductorGraphicV2 that we already have but aren't utilizing or something we should add to useAnimation?"

Let me check what's currently used in AiConductorGraphicV2:
- **environment plugin** ✓ (battery, FPS, reducedMotion, idle) - line 169-176
- **events plugin** ✓ (busName: 'conductor') - line 176

Looking at the component's animation needs:
1. Manual RAF orchestration for precise timing (line 345-449)
2. Viewport detection with useElementVisibility (line 140-143)
3. Timeout-based sequencing in children components
4. CSS custom properties for animation control (line 312-320)

**POTENTIALLY BENEFICIAL PLUGINS:**

1. **scrollPlugin** - NOT beneficial
   - Component uses viewport visibility, not scroll-based triggers
   - Already has useElementVisibility doing the job

2. **timelinePlugin** - HIGHLY BENEFICIAL ⭐
   - Component has complex manual RAF orchestration (line 400-446)
   - Could replace setTimeout chains in children with declarative timeline
   - Would provide pause/resume/seek capabilities
   - Better debugging with timeline inspection
   - Example: Replace manual cycle timing with timeline keyframes

3. **staggerPlugin** - MODERATELY BENEFICIAL
   - SocialPathway activations could use stagger in rotation mode
   - Currently manually calculated: `(index * cycleDurationMs) / providerCount` (line 410)
   - stagger would make this declarative

4. **cssAnimationPlugin** - LIMITED BENEFIT
   - Already setting CSS custom properties manually (line 312-320)
   - Could formalize this through the plugin
   - Benefit: Automatic cleanup and type safety

5. **performancePlugin** - ALREADY COVERED
   - Environment plugin already handles FPS/battery
   - No additional benefit

**RECOMMENDATION:**
Add **timelinePlugin** to replace manual RAF orchestration. This would:
- Simplify the complex loop logic (line 400-446)
- Provide declarative cycle definitions
- Enable timeline.seek() for testing
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount
- Better integration with environment pauses   │

│ Final synthesis of all findings:

**SUMMARY OF ANSWERS:**

1. **useAnimation instances:** 4 total (not 1)
   - AiConductorGraphicV2
   - AnimatedFloatingElement  
   - SocialPathway
   - PlatformIconSequence

2. **CSS-driven animations:** Mixed approach
   - AiOrb: Pure CSS @keyframes
   - PlatformIconSequence: Hybrid (CSS @keyframes + WAAPI)
   - SparkAnimation/SocialIcon/SocialPostCard: Pure WAAPI via VueUse Motion

3. **AnimatedFloatingElement instances:** Exactly 1 (wrapping the entire conductor)

4. **Adding cssAnimationPlugin to children:** NOT recommended
   - Overhead: Would add 3-4 more useAnimation instances
   - Poor fit: Most children use WAAPI, not CSS @keyframes
   - Already solved: Environment detection handled by parent + event bus
   - Better approach: Keep current architecture with centralized environment detection

5. **Beneficial plugins to add:**
   - **timelinePlugin** ⭐ HIGHLY recommended
     - Replace manual RAF orchestration (line 400-446)
     - Declarative cycle/sequence definitions
     - Better debugging and testing
     - Automatic cleanup
   - **staggerPlugin** - Moderate benefit for rotation mode pathway activations
   - **cssAnimationPlugin** - Minor benefit for formalizing CSS custom property management

**KEY INSIGHT:** The current hybrid approach is actually well-designed. Parent handles environment detection via useAnimation, broadcasts state via event bus, and children respond. The main improvement opportunity is replacing manual RAF timing with timelinePlugin for better maintainability.   │

│ **Current Manual RAF Orchestration Logic Deep Dive**

Let me trace through the AiConductorGraphicV2 manual RAF logic in detail:

**Key Variables:**
- `animationFrameId` - RAF handle
- `animationStartTime` - When entire orchestration started (timestamp)
- `currentCycleStartTime` - When current cycle started  
- `currentCycleIndex` - Which cycle iteration (0, 1, 2...)
- `cycleDuration` - Total duration of one cycle (from props, in seconds, converted to ms)

**orchestrateAnimation() Flow:**
1. Clears any existing orchestration
2. Checks `animation.canAnimate.value` (environment detection from useAnimation)
3. Sets `isPlaying = true`
4. Emits 'orchestration-start' event
5. Initializes timing: `animationStartTime = performance.now()`, `currentCycleStartTime = animationStartTime`, `currentCycleIndex = 0`
6. Starts RAF loop with `animateLoop(currentTime)`

**animateLoop(currentTime) - The Core Logic:**
```typescript
const elapsedSinceStart = currentTime - animationStartTime  // Total elapsed
const elapsedSinceCycleStart = currentTime - currentCycleStartTime  // Cycle elapsed
const cycleDurationMs = cycleDuration.value * 1000

// ROTATION MODE (line 408-422)
if (currentMode.value === 'rotation') {
  const providerCount = validatedProviders.value.length
  const timePerProvider = cycleDurationMs / providerCount
  
  // For each provider, check if we're in its activation window
  validatedProviders.value.forEach((provider, index) => {
    const activationTime = index * timePerProvider
    const nextActivationTime = (index + 1) * timePerProvider
    
    // Activate if current time is within this provider's window
    if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= activationTime && 
        elapsedSinceCycleStart < nextActivationTime) {
      busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
    }
  })
}

// UNISON MODE (line 424-430)
else {
  // Trigger once at the start of cycle (first 50ms)
  if (elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) {
    validatedProviders.value.forEach((provider, index) => {
      busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'unison' })
    })
  }
}

// Chat bubble cycling (line 433-435)
if (props.showConductorCommand && elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) {
  busEmitSafe('bubble-cycle-start')
}

// Check if cycle complete (line 438-443)
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= cycleDurationMs) {
  currentCycleStartTime = currentTime
  currentCycleIndex++
  emit('animationComplete', 'orchestration')
  emit('animationStart', 'orchestration')  // Start next cycle
}

// Continue loop
animationFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(animateLoop)
```

**Critical Behavior Details:**
1. **Rotation mode continuous checking**: Every RAF frame checks ALL providers to see if we're in their time window
2. **No "already activated" flag**: Could potentially emit same event multiple times per window
3. **Cycle reset timing**: Sets `currentCycleStartTime = currentTime` (current timestamp, not calculated offset)
4. **Infinite loop**: Never stops unless `stopAnimation()` called externally
5. **No pause/resume support**: Would need external coordination
6. **Event-driven child activation**: Emits bus events, children listen and activate themselves   │

│ **timelinePlugin Logic Deep Dive**

From the timelinePlugin.ts code, here's how it would handle the same scenario:

**Configuration Structure:**
```typescript
timeline: {
  cycleDuration: 7000,  // 7 seconds total cycle
  mode: 'parallel' or 'sequential' or 'staggered',
  loop: true,
  loopDelay: 0,
  phases: [
    {
      name: 'pathway-0',
      target: pathway0Ref,
      delay: 0,          // When to start (relative to mode)
      duration: 2000,    // How long animation lasts
      animation: { preset: 'fadeIn' },
      onStart: (ctx) => { /* activate pathway */ }
    },
    // ... more phases
  ]
}
```

**Key Differences in Logic:**

**1. Phase Activation (line 496-498):**
```typescript
phases.value.forEach(phase => {
  if (elapsed >= phase.delay) {
    activatePhase(phase, elapsed)  // Only activates ONCE
  }
})
```
- **State tracking**: `phaseStates.get(phase.name).started` prevents re-activation
- **One-time trigger**: Phase activates exactly once per cycle
- **Current logic**: Checks every frame, could emit multiple times

**2. Cycle Completion (line 506-533):**
```typescript
if (elapsed >= options.cycleDuration || allPhasesCompleted()) {
  if (options.events?.onCycleComplete) {
    options.events.onCycleComplete()
  }
  
  if (options.loop && context.isPlaying.value) {
    if (options.loopDelay && options.loopDelay > 0) {
      // Enter delay state
      timelineState.isInDelay = true
      timelineState.delayStartTime = timestamp
    } else {
      // Immediate restart
      resetTimeline()
      currentCycle.value++
      timelineState.startTime = timestamp
    }
  }
}
```
- **Explicit loop delay support**: Can pause between cycles
- **State machine**: isInDelay flag for clean loop management
- **Current logic**: No delay support, immediate restart

**3. Mode Handling:**
Timeline has 3 modes but CURRENT orchestration only has 2 (rotation vs unison):
- **sequential**: Each phase waits for previous (delay relative to previous end)
- **parallel**: All start together (delay relative to timeline start) → **MATCHES UNISON**
- **staggered**: Overlapping phases (delay relative to timeline start) → **MATCHES ROTATION**

**4. Progress Tracking (line 390-410):**
```typescript
const phaseElapsed = elapsed - phase.delay
const progress = Math.min(1, Math.max(0, phaseElapsed / phase.duration))

if (phase.onProgress && Math.abs(progress - state.lastProgress) > 0.01) {
  phase.onProgress(progress, phaseContext)
  state.lastProgress = progress
}
```
- **Per-phase progress**: 0-1 for each phase individually
- **Throttled callbacks**: Only fires when progress changes >1%
- **Current logic**: No progress tracking, just activation   │

│ **CRITICAL REGRESSION RISKS**

**Risk #1: Re-activation Bug in Current Code**
Current rotation mode checks EVERY frame:
```typescript
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= activationTime && 
    elapsedSinceCycleStart < nextActivationTime) {
  busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
}
```

Problem: During window [0-2333ms], provider 0 gets activated EVERY FRAME (~144 times at 60fps)!

**Current workaround**: Children probably ignore duplicate activations OR animations are idempotent

**timelinePlugin fix**: `state.started` flag prevents re-activation (line 323)
```typescript
if (!state || state.started) return  // Skip if already started
```

**REGRESSION**: If children RELY on multiple activation calls, switching to timeline breaks them.
**MITIGATION**: Check if children (SocialPathway, PlatformIconSequence) handle duplicate events.

---

**Risk #2: Timing Precision Drift**

Current code:
```typescript
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= cycleDurationMs) {
  currentCycleStartTime = currentTime  // Uses actual current time
  currentCycleIndex++
}
```

Uses ACTUAL timestamp = can drift if frames are dropped (e.g., 7000ms cycle might take 7016ms)

timelinePlugin:
```typescript
timelineState.startTime = timestamp  // Also uses actual timestamp
```

**SAME BEHAVIOR** - Both use actual timestamps, so timing drift is identical.

**NO REGRESSION** on this point.

---

**Risk #3: Event Bus Timing**

Current code emits:
```typescript
busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
```

timelinePlugin would call:
```typescript
phase.onStart(phaseContext)  // Direct callback
```

**DIFFERENT MECHANISM**:
- Current: Event bus (async, decoupled)
- Timeline: Direct callback (sync, coupled)

**REGRESSION**: Timeline doesn't use event bus, would need wrapper:
```typescript
phases: [
  {
    name: 'pathway-0',
    target: pathway0Ref,
    delay: 0,
    duration: sparkDuration,
    onStart: (ctx) => {
      animation.emit('pathway-activate', { index: 0, provider: 'instagram', delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
    }
  }
]
```

**MITIGATION**: Wrap timeline callbacks to emit same bus events.

---

**Risk #4: Chat Bubble Timing**

Current code:
```typescript
if (props.showConductorCommand && elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) {
  busEmitSafe('bubble-cycle-start')
}
```

Emits ONCE per cycle (within first 50ms window).

Timeline equivalent:
```typescript
{
  name: 'bubble-cycle',
  target: sequenceRef,  // Dummy target
  delay: 0,
  duration: 1,  // Minimal duration
  onStart: () => {
    animation.emit('bubble-cycle-start')
  }
}
```

**SAME BEHAVIOR** - Timeline can replicate this.

**NO REGRESSION** if configured correctly.   │

│ **Mapping Current Logic to timelinePlugin**

**ROTATION MODE Mapping:**

Current calculation (6 providers, 7000ms cycle):
```typescript
const timePerProvider = 7000 / 6 = 1166.67ms
Provider 0: activationTime = 0ms      → nextActivationTime = 1166.67ms
Provider 1: activationTime = 1166.67ms → nextActivationTime = 2333.33ms
Provider 2: activationTime = 2333.33ms → nextActivationTime = 3500ms
Provider 3: activationTime = 3500ms    → nextActivationTime = 4666.67ms
Provider 4: activationTime = 4666.67ms → nextActivationTime = 5833.33ms
Provider 5: activationTime = 5833.33ms → nextActivationTime = 7000ms
```

Timeline phases (staggered mode):
```typescript
timeline: {
  cycleDuration: 7000,
  mode: 'staggered',  // or 'parallel' since delays are relative to start
  loop: true,
  phases: validatedProviders.value.map((provider, index) => {
    const timePerProvider = (cycleDuration * 1000) / validatedProviders.value.length
    const activationTime = index * timePerProvider
    
    return {
      name: `pathway-${index}`,
      target: pathwayRefs.value[index],
      delay: activationTime,  // When to start
      duration: animationTiming.value[index].sparkDuration,  // Spark travel time
      onStart: (ctx) => {
        animation.emit('pathway-activate', { 
          index, 
          provider, 
          delay: 0, 
          mode: 'rotation' 
        })
      }
    }
  })
}
```

**EXACT MATCH** - Timeline phases align perfectly with rotation timing.

---

**UNISON MODE Mapping:**

Current logic:
```typescript
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) {
  validatedProviders.value.forEach((provider, index) => {
    busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'unison' })
  })
}
```

Timeline phases (parallel mode):
```typescript
timeline: {
  cycleDuration: 7000,
  mode: 'parallel',
  loop: true,
  phases: validatedProviders.value.map((provider, index) => ({
    name: `pathway-${index}`,
    target: pathwayRefs.value[index],
    delay: 0,  // All start at 0
    duration: animationTiming.value[index].sparkDuration,
    onStart: (ctx) => {
      animation.emit('pathway-activate', { 
        index, 
        provider, 
        delay: 0, 
        mode: 'unison' 
      })
    }
  }))
}
```

**EXACT MATCH** - All phases start at delay: 0, just like current unison logic.

---

**Chat Bubble Phase:**
```typescript
{
  name: 'bubble-cycle',
  target: sequenceRef,
  delay: 0,
  duration: 1,
  onStart: (ctx) => {
    if (props.showConductorCommand) {
      animation.emit('bubble-cycle-start')
    }
  }
}

│ **Key Behavioral Differences That Could Cause Regressions**

**Difference #1: Phase State Tracking**

Current code has NO state tracking for activations:
- Provider 0 window (0-1166ms): Event emitted EVERY frame (~70 emissions)
- Provider 1 window (1166-2333ms): Event emitted EVERY frame (~70 emissions)
- etc.

Timeline has state tracking (line 322-323):
```typescript
const state = phaseStates.get(phase.name)
if (!state || state.started) return  // Only activate once
```

**TEST NEEDED**: Check if children handle duplicate events
```typescript
// In SocialPathway.vue (line 146-157)
const unsubscribeActivate = animation.on('pathway-activate', (payload) => {
  const { index, delay, mode = 'unison' } = payload
  if (index === props.index) {
    if (delay > 0) {
      addTimeout(() => {
        activatePathway(mode)
      }, delay)
    } else {
      activatePathway(mode)
    }
  }
})
```

Looking at `activatePathway()` (line 107-132):
```typescript
const activatePathway = (mode = 'unison') => {
  clearTimeouts()  // ✅ Clears previous timeouts
  
  if (animation.animationQuality.value === 'none' || !animation.canAnimate.value) {
    // Skip animation
    return
  }
  
  sparkRef.value?.animate()  // Calls useAnimate
  
  addTimeout(() => {
    iconRef.value?.pulse()
    if (props.showResponse) {
      addTimeout(() => {
        responseRef.value?.show()
      }, 200)
    }
  }, iconPulseDelay)
}
```

**FINDING**: `clearTimeouts()` makes it idempotent for rapid calls!
- Multiple pathway-activate events → clearTimeouts() cancels previous → new timeout set
- **Timeline's single activation is SAFER** but current code handles duplicates

**REGRESSION RISK: LOW** - Children are designed to handle duplicates via clearTimeouts()

---

**Difference #2: Cycle Reset Timing Calculation**

Current code (line 438-442):
```typescript
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= cycleDurationMs) {
  currentCycleStartTime = currentTime  // ⚠️ Uses ACTUAL current time
  currentCycleIndex++
  emit('animationComplete', 'orchestration')
  emit('animationStart', 'orchestration')
}
```

Timeline (line 520-523):
```typescript
// Immediate restart
resetTimeline()
currentCycle.value++
timelineState.startTime = timestamp  // Same - uses actual timestamp
```

**SAME BEHAVIOR** - Both use actual timestamps, drift behavior identical.

**REGRESSION RISK: NONE**

---

**Difference #3: Environment Pause Integration**

Current code uses `animation.canAnimate.value` check (line 385):
```typescript
if (!animation.canAnimate.value || !isVisible.value) {
  return  // Don't start
}
```

Plus RAF pause/resume with `useRafFn` (line 191-200):
```typescript
const { pause: pauseRaf, resume: resumeRaf } = useRafFn(() => {
  if (!isViewportReady.value) {
    stopAnimation()
  } else if (!isPlaying.value && isComponentReady.value) {
    orchestrateAnimation()
  }
}, { immediate: false })
```

Timeline uses `context.isPlaying.value` (line 457-460):
```typescript
const timelineRaf = createRafControls(({ timestamp }) => {
  if (!context.isPlaying.value) {
    timelineRaf.pause()
    return
  }
  // ...
})
```

**DIFFERENT CONTROL FLOW**:
- Current: Manually manages RAF pause/resume based on viewport
- Timeline: Relies on `context.isPlaying.value` which is controlled by parent useAnimation

**INTEGRATION NEEDED**: Timeline needs external play/pause control:
```typescript
// Parent would need:
watch(isViewportReady, (ready) => {
  if (ready && !animation.timeline.isPlaying) {
    play()  // Starts timeline
  } else if (!ready && animation.timeline.isPlaying) {
    pause()  // Pauses timeline
  }
})
```

**REGRESSION RISK: MEDIUM** - Timeline doesn't auto-start/stop based on viewport   │

│ **Difference #4: Dynamic Provider Changes**

Current code watches `validatedProviders` (line 328-342):
```typescript
watch(() => validatedProviders.value, (newProviders) => {
  const newLength = newProviders.length
  const currentLength = pathwayRefs.value.length
  
  if (newLength !== currentLength) {
    // Adjust pathway refs array
    if (newLength > currentLength) {
      pathwayRefs.value.push(...new Array(newLength - currentLength).fill(null))
    } else {
      pathwayRefs.value.splice(newLength, currentLength - newLength)
    }
  }
}, { immediate: true })
```

**Then recomputes** `pathwayConfigs` (line 297-310) and `animationTiming` (line 267-294) automatically via computed properties.

Timeline phases are **STATIC** after initialization:
```typescript
const phases = ref<TimelinePhase[]>(options.phases || [])  // Fixed array
```

**REGRESSION**: If `providersDisplayed` prop changes at runtime, timeline won't update!

**MITIGATION**: Use computed phases or watch for changes:
```typescript
const timelinePhases = computed(() => {
  return validatedProviders.value.map((provider, index) => ({
    name: `pathway-${index}`,
    target: pathwayRefs.value[index],
    delay: animationTiming.value[index].sparkStart,
    duration: animationTiming.value[index].sparkDuration,
    onStart: (ctx) => {
      animation.emit('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: currentMode.value })
    }
  }))
})

// Then use timeline with reactive phases
const animation = useAnimation(conductorRef, {
  timeline: {
    cycleDuration: computed(() => props.cycleDuration * 1000),
    mode: computed(() => props.mode === 'rotation' ? 'staggered' : 'parallel'),
    loop: true,
    phases: timelinePhases  // ⚠️ Does timeline plugin support reactive phases?
  }
})
```

**CHECKING timeline plugin**: Line 283 shows `phases = ref<TimelinePhase[]>(options.phases || [])`

This is a ref, but it's initialized ONCE. Timeline doesn't watch `options.phases` for changes!

**REGRESSION RISK: HIGH** - Dynamic provider changes would be IGNORED

**REQUIRED FIX**: Need to watch phases and reinitialize timeline:
```typescript
watch(timelinePhases, (newPhases) => {
  animation.timeline.stop()  // Stop current
  animation.timeline.phases.value = newPhases  // Update phases
  animation.timeline.play()  // Restart
})
```

But this creates a visible restart flicker!

---

**Difference #5: Mode Switching**

Current code watches mode changes (line 323-325):
```typescript
watch(() => props.mode, (newMode) => {
  currentMode.value = newMode
}, { immediate: true })
```

**Then continues running** with new mode in next RAF frame (line 408-430 conditionals).

Timeline would need:
```typescript
watch(() => props.mode, (newMode) => {
  animation.timeline.stop()
  // Recreate timeline with new mode
  animation.timeline.mode = newMode === 'rotation' ? 'staggered' : 'parallel'
  animation.timeline.play()
})
```

Again, **visible restart flicker**.

**REGRESSION RISK: MEDIUM-HIGH** - Smooth mode transitions become jarring restarts

---

**Difference #6: Floating Animation Coordination**

Current code has `isFloatingAnimating` flag (line 187):
```typescript
const isFloatingAnimating = ref(false)

const handleFloatingElementStart = (type: 'enter' | 'exit') => {
  isFloatingAnimating.value = true
  
  if (type === 'exit') {
    busEmitSafe('stop-all', undefined, { force: true })
    stopAnimation()
  }
}

const handleFloatingElementComplete = (type: 'enter' | 'exit') => {
  isFloatingAnimating.value = false
  
  if (type === 'enter' && !isPlaying.value && isComponentReady.value) {
    orchestrateAnimation()  // Auto-restart after float-in
  }
}
```

**Critical**: Auto-restarts orchestration after AnimatedFloatingElement completes enter animation.

Timeline equivalent would need:
```typescript
const handleFloatingElementComplete = (type: 'enter' | 'exit') => {
  isFloatingAnimating.value = false
  
  if (type === 'enter' && !isPlaying.value && isComponentReady.value) {
    animation.play()  // Would this trigger timeline.play()?
  }
}
```

**YES** - Calling `animation.play()` (from useAnimation) triggers all plugin systems including timeline.

**REGRESSION RISK: LOW** - Timeline integrates with play() system   │

│ **TESTING STRATEGY FOR CORRECTNESS**

**Test 1: Single Activation Verification**

Current behavior: Multiple emissions per provider window
Timeline behavior: Single emission per provider per cycle

**Test approach:**
```typescript
// Add activation counter to SocialPathway
const activationCount = ref(0)

const unsubscribeActivate = animation.on('pathway-activate', (payload) => {
  const { index } = payload
  if (index === props.index) {
    activationCount.value++  // Count how many times we're activated
    activatePathway(mode)
  }
})

// After one full cycle, check count
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log(`Pathway ${props.index} activated ${activationCount.value} times`)
  // Current: ~70 times (one per frame in window)
  // Timeline: 1 time (single activation)
}, cycleDuration + 100)
```

**Expected outcome**: Timeline should show `activationCount.value === 1`

**Regression check**: Verify animations still work with single activation

---

**Test 2: Cycle Timing Precision**

**Test approach:**
```typescript
let cycleStartTimes: number[] = []
let cycleEndTimes: number[] = []

// In orchestrateAnimation() or timeline onCycleStart:
cycleStartTimes.push(performance.now())

// In cycle complete handler or timeline onCycleComplete:
cycleEndTimes.push(performance.now())

// After 5 cycles:
setTimeout(() => {
  const durations = cycleEndTimes.map((end, i) => end - cycleStartTimes[i])
  console.log('Cycle durations:', durations)
  
  const avgDuration = durations.reduce((a, b) => a + b) / durations.length
  const expectedDuration = props.cycleDuration * 1000
  const drift = Math.abs(avgDuration - expectedDuration)
  
  console.log(`Average drift: ${drift}ms per cycle`)
  // Acceptable: < 50ms drift
}, (props.cycleDuration * 1000 * 5) + 500)
```

**Expected outcome**: Both implementations should show similar drift (< 50ms per cycle)

---

**Test 3: Dynamic Provider Changes**

**Test approach:**
```typescript
// Start with 3 providers
const providers = ref(['instagram', 'facebook', 'threads'])

// After 2 cycles, add 3 more
setTimeout(() => {
  providers.value = ['instagram', 'facebook', 'threads', 'linkedin', 'tiktok', 'youtube']
}, props.cycleDuration * 1000 * 2)

// Verify: Do all 6 providers animate in next cycle?
```

**Expected outcome - Current**: Immediately adapts, all 6 providers animate
**Expected outcome - Timeline**: Might NOT adapt unless we add reactive phases watcher

**Regression**: Timeline fails this test without fixes

---

**Test 4: Mode Switching Mid-Cycle**

**Test approach:**
```typescript
const mode = ref('rotation')

// Switch to unison mid-cycle
setTimeout(() => {
  mode.value = 'unison'
}, (props.cycleDuration * 1000 * 0.5))  // Halfway through cycle

// Observe: Does animation adapt smoothly or restart?
```

**Expected outcome - Current**: Smooth transition (next frame uses new mode)
**Expected outcome - Timeline**: Would need restart (jarring)

**Regression**: Timeline creates visible restart

---

**Test 5: Viewport Pause/Resume**

**Test approach:**
```typescript
// Scroll component out of viewport
setTimeout(() => {
  window.scrollTo({ top: 2000, behavior: 'instant' })
}, 2000)

// Scroll back into viewport
setTimeout(() => {
  window.scrollTo({ top: 0, behavior: 'instant' })
}, 4000)

// Verify: Does animation pause when out of view and resume when back?
```

**Expected outcome - Current**: Auto-pauses via RAF watcher
**Expected outcome - Timeline**: Needs manual play/pause integration

**Regression**: Timeline doesn't auto-pause without wrapper   │

│ **ENSURING CORRECTNESS DURING REFACTOR - MIGRATION STRATEGY**

**Phase 1: Add Timeline Alongside Current (Dual-Mode Testing)**

Keep both implementations running in parallel with feature flag:
```typescript
const USE_TIMELINE = ref(false)  // Toggle for testing

const animation = useAnimation(conductorRef, {
  environment: { /* existing */ },
  events: { busName: 'conductor' },
  ...(USE_TIMELINE.value ? {
    timeline: {
      cycleDuration: computed(() => props.cycleDuration * 1000),
      mode: computed(() => props.mode === 'rotation' ? 'staggered' : 'parallel'),
      loop: true,
      phases: computed(() => createTimelinePhases()),
      events: {
        onCycleStart: () => {
          console.log('[Timeline] Cycle started')
        },
        onCycleComplete: () => {
          console.log('[Timeline] Cycle completed')
        }
      }
    }
  } : {})
})

// Keep manual RAF as fallback
if (!USE_TIMELINE.value) {
  // Existing orchestrateAnimation() logic
  onMounted(() => {
    if (animation.canAnimate.value && isVisible.value) {
      orchestrateAnimation()
    }
  })
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Can A/B test both implementations
- Easy rollback if issues found
- Side-by-side comparison of behavior
- Zero risk during development

---

**Phase 2: Fix Timeline Limitations**

**Fix 2.1: Reactive Phases Support**
```typescript
const timelinePhases = computed(() => {
  return validatedProviders.value.map((provider, index) => {
    const timing = animationTiming.value[index]
    
    return {
      name: `pathway-${index}-${provider}`,  // Unique per provider change
      target: pathwayRefs.value[index],
      delay: timing.sparkStart,
      duration: timing.sparkDuration,
      onStart: (ctx) => {
        animation.emit('pathway-activate', { 
          index, 
          provider, 
          delay: 0, 
          mode: currentMode.value 
        })
      },
      onComplete: (ctx) => {
        // Optional: Track completion for debugging
      }
    }
  })
})

// Watch for phase changes and restart timeline
watch(timelinePhases, (newPhases) => {
  if (!USE_TIMELINE.value) return
  
  // Only restart if phase count or structure changed
  const oldPhaseCount = animation.timeline?.phases.value.length || 0
  if (oldPhaseCount !== newPhases.length) {
    console.log('[Timeline] Provider count changed, restarting')
    animation.stop()
    animation.timeline.phases.value = newPhases
    animation.play()
  }
}, { deep: false })
```

**Fix 2.2: Mode Switching Support**
```typescript
watch(() => props.mode, (newMode, oldMode) => {
  if (!USE_TIMELINE.value || newMode === oldMode) return
  
  // Smooth mode transition: finish current cycle first
  const onCycleComplete = () => {
    // Update timeline mode
    // Note: Timeline plugin doesn't expose mode setter
    // Would need to recreate timeline with new config
    
    // Alternative: Use same phases, just change activation logic
    // All phases start at same time = unison
    // Phases staggered = rotation
    
    // For now, restart immediately
    animation.stop()
    // Recreate useAnimation with new timeline config?
    // This is complex - might be better to keep manual mode switching
  }
  
  // Listen for next cycle complete
  const unsub = animation.on('cycle-complete', onCycleComplete)
  
  // Cleanup after one trigger
  setTimeout(() => unsub(), props.cycleDuration * 1000 + 100)
})
```

**Actually, mode switching reveals timeline plugin limitation:**
Timeline's `mode` is set at initialization and can't be changed dynamically.

**BETTER APPROACH**: Keep manual mode handling, use timeline for timing only:
```typescript
// Don't use timeline's mode system
// Instead, manually calculate phase delays based on props.mode
const timelinePhases = computed(() => {
  const isRotation = props.mode === 'rotation'
  
  return validatedProviders.value.map((provider, index) => {
    const timing = animationTiming.value[index]
    
    return {
      name: `pathway-${index}`,
      target: pathwayRefs.value[index],
      delay: isRotation ? timing.sparkStart : 0,  // Manual mode logic
      duration: timing.sparkDuration,
      onStart: (ctx) => {
        animation.emit('pathway-activate', { 
          index, 
          provider, 
          delay: 0, 
          mode: props.mode  // Pass actual mode
        })
      }
    }
  })
})
```

**Fix 2.3: Viewport Integration**
```typescript
// Timeline doesn't auto-start/stop based on viewport
// Add manual integration
watch(isViewportReady, (ready) => {
  if (!USE_TIMELINE.value) return
  
  if (ready && !isPlaying.value && isComponentReady.value && !isFloatingAnimating.value) {
    animation.play()  // This calls timeline.play()
  } else if (!ready && isPlaying.value) {
    animation.pause()  // This calls timeline.pause()
  }
})

// Also watch canAnimate for environment changes
watch(() => animation.canAnimate.value, (canAnimate) => {
  if (!USE_TIMELINE.value) return
  
  if (!canAnimate && isPlaying.value) {
    animation.stop()
  } else if (canAnimate && isViewportReady.value && !isPlaying.value) {
    animation.play()
  }
})
```

**Phase 3: Validation Checklist**

Before removing manual RAF:

✅ **Timing Accuracy**
- [ ] Cycle durations match (±50ms tolerance)
- [ ] Provider activation timing matches
- [ ] Chat bubble timing matches
- [ ] Loop restarts happen at correct time

✅ **Dynamic Behavior**
- [ ] Provider count changes handled
- [ ] Mode switches work (rotation ↔ unison)
- [ ] Props changes (cycleDuration, sparkSpeed) apply correctly

✅ **Environment Integration**
- [ ] Viewport pause/resume works
- [ ] canAnimate respects reduced motion
- [ ] Battery/FPS degradation pauses animation
- [ ] FloatingElement coordination works

✅ **Event Bus Correctness**
- [ ] pathway-activate events fire at right times
- [ ] bubble-cycle-start fires once per cycle
- [ ] stop-all event stops timeline
- [ ] Event payloads match expected format

✅ **Performance**
- [ ] No visible jank or frame drops
- [ ] Timeline RAF overhead acceptable
- [ ] Memory usage stable over long runs
- [ ] No memory leaks from phase watchers

✅ **Edge Cases**
- [ ] Rapid play/pause/stop cycles
- [ ] Component unmount mid-animation
- [ ] Zero providers edge case
- [ ] Single provider edge case
- [ ] Very short cycle durations (<1s)
- [ ] Very long cycle durations (>30s)

---

**Phase 4: Gradual Rollout**

```typescript
// Start with 10% of users
const USE_TIMELINE = ref(Math.random() < 0.1)

// Add telemetry
watch(isPlaying, (playing) => {
  if (playing) {
    analytics.track('conductor-animation-start', {
      implementation: USE_TIMELINE.value ? 'timeline' : 'manual',
      mode: props.mode,
      providerCount: validatedProviders.value.length
    })
  }
})

// Monitor for errors
onErrorCaptured((err) => {
  if (USE_TIMELINE.value) {
    analytics.track('conductor-timeline-error', {
      error: err.message,
      stack: err.stack
    })
  }
})

// After 1 week of stable data: 50% rollout
// After 2 weeks: 100% rollout
// After 1 month: Remove manual RAF code

│ **CRITICAL INSIGHT: Timeline Plugin Limitations for This Use Case**

After deep analysis, I've identified **3 fundamental mismatches** between timelinePlugin design and AiConductorGraphicV2 needs:

**Mismatch #1: Static vs Dynamic Phases**

Timeline is designed for **fixed sequences** (hero animations, page transitions).
AiConductorGraphicV2 has **dynamic sequences** (provider count, mode, duration can change).

Timeline's phase array is initialized once (line 283):
```typescript
const phases = ref<TimelinePhase[]>(options.phases || [])
```

No built-in watcher for `options.phases` changes. Would need manual intervention:
```typescript
watch(computedPhases, (newPhases) => {
  animation.timeline.phases.value = newPhases
  animation.stop()
  animation.play()  // Visible restart
})
```

**Current manual RAF**: Adapts seamlessly via computed properties (no restart).

**Verdict**: Timeline adds complexity for dynamic use cases.

---

**Mismatch #2: Event-Driven Architecture**

Current architecture is **event-driven**:
- Parent emits `pathway-activate` events
- Children (SocialPathway, PlatformIconSequence) listen and self-activate
- Loose coupling - children don't know about parent's timing logic

Timeline is **callback-driven**:
- Timeline calls `phase.onStart()`
- Phases must emit events manually as wrapper
- Adds layer of indirection

Current:
```typescript
// RAF loop directly emits
busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
```

Timeline:
```typescript
// Timeline calls onStart, which must emit
onStart: (ctx) => {
  animation.emit('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
}
```

**Extra wrapper layer** with no benefit - we're not using timeline's animation system (no keyframes, just event coordination).

**Verdict**: Timeline doesn't simplify - it adds wrapper boilerplate.

---

**Mismatch #3: Infinite Loop with No Natural End**

Timeline is designed for **finite sequences** with clear completion:
- Hero animation finishes after N phases
- Page transition completes
- Tutorial steps end

AiConductorGraphicV2 is an **infinite ambient animation**:
- Loops forever until component unmounts
- No natural "end" state
- Designed to run continuously

Timeline's loop system (line 513-527):
```typescript
if (options.loop && context.isPlaying.value) {
  if (options.loopDelay && options.loopDelay > 0) {
    timelineState.isInDelay = true
    timelineState.delayStartTime = timestamp
  } else {
    resetTimeline()
    currentCycle.value++
    timelineState.startTime = timestamp
  }
}
```

Works, but **designed for controlled loops** (loop 3 times, then stop).

Current manual RAF:
```typescript
// Infinite loop by default, clean and simple
animationFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(animateLoop)
```

**Verdict**: Timeline's loop machinery is overkill for simple infinite loop.

---

**RECOMMENDATION: HYBRID APPROACH**

Instead of full timeline migration, use timeline **only for complex sub-sequences**:

**Keep manual RAF for:**
- Main cycle loop (infinite, simple)
- Mode switching (rotation vs unison)
- Dynamic provider changes

**Use timeline for:**
- Complex multi-step pathway choreography (if needed in future)
- Coordinating multiple independent animations
- When we add features like "pause between cycles" or "run X times then stop"

**Current code is actually well-suited for its use case** because:
1. ✅ Simple infinite loop - don't need timeline's complexity
2. ✅ Event-driven - children self-manage
3. ✅ Dynamic - providers/mode/duration can change on the fly
4. ✅ Lightweight - minimal overhead
5. ✅ Debuggable - clear RAF loop logic

**Where timeline WOULD help:**
1. If we wanted pause/resume with preserved timing offsets
2. If we needed to scrub timeline (timeline.seek(0.5))
3. If we had complex dependencies between phases
4. If we needed precise per-phase progress tracking

**None of these are current requirements.**

---

**ALTERNATIVE: Improve Current RAF with Timeline-Inspired Patterns**

Instead of switching to timeline, **adopt timeline's best practices**:

**Pattern 1: State Tracking (Prevent Re-activation)**
```typescript
const phaseStates = reactive<Map<number, { started: boolean, completed: boolean }>>(new Map())

// In rotation mode
validatedProviders.value.forEach((provider, index) => {
  const state = phaseStates.get(index)
  if (!state || state.started) return  // Skip if already activated
  
  if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= activationTime && 
      elapsedSinceCycleStart < nextActivationTime) {
    state.started = true  // Mark as started
    busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
  }
})

// Reset on cycle complete
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= cycleDurationMs) {
  phaseStates.forEach(state => {
    state.started = false
    state.completed = false
  })
  // ... rest of cycle reset
}
```

**Benefit**: Prevents duplicate emissions (70 → 1 per window) while keeping RAF simplicity.

**Pattern 2: Centralized RAF Coordinator**
```typescript
import { createRafControls } from '@animations/composables/useAnimation/rafCoordinator'

const orchestrationRaf = createRafControls(({ timestamp, deltaTime, fps }) => {
  if (!isViewportReady.value || !animation.canAnimate.value) {
    orchestrationRaf.pause()
    return
  }
  
  // Existing animateLoop logic here
}, { immediate: false })

// Start/stop becomes simpler
const orchestrateAnimation = () => {
  orchestrationRaf.resume()
}

const stopAnimation = () => {
  orchestrationRaf.pause()
}
```

**Benefit**: Reuses useAnimation's RAF coordinator (same as timeline uses).

**Pattern 3: Lifecycle Events**
```typescript
// Add structured lifecycle
const emit CycleEvent = (type: 'start' | 'complete') => {
  emit(`animation${type === 'start' ? 'Start' : 'Complete'}`, 'orchestration')
  
  if (options.events?.[`onCycle${type === 'start' ? 'Start' : 'Complete'}`]) {
    options.events[`onCycle${type === 'start' ? 'Start' : 'Complete'}`]()
  }
}
```

**Benefit**: Matches timeline's event API for consistency.   │

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ **FINAL VERDICT & RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Should you switch to timelinePlugin? NO - Not for this use case.**

**Reasons:**

1. **Timeline is overengineered for infinite ambient loops**
   - Designed for finite sequences with clear completion
   - AiConductorGraphicV2 is infinite loop with simple cycle logic
   - Timeline's state machine (isInDelay, phaseStates, etc.) adds complexity without benefit

2. **Dynamic behavior creates friction**
   - Provider count changes require timeline restart (visible flicker)
   - Mode switching requires recreation
   - Current RAF adapts seamlessly via computed properties

3. **Event architecture mismatch**
   - Current: Direct event emission (clean)
   - Timeline: Callback wrapper → emit (extra layer)
   - Timeline doesn't use its animation system (we only need timing, not keyframes)

4. **Current code is already good**
   - Clear, debuggable RAF loop
   - Minimal overhead
   - Handles dynamic changes
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Only minor issue: duplicate emissions (easily fixed)

---

**RECOMMENDED IMPROVEMENTS (Keep RAF, Add Patterns)**

**Improvement 1: Add State Tracking (5 min effort)**
```typescript
const providerActivationStates = ref<Set<number>>(new Set())

// In rotation mode loop
if (!providerActivationStates.value.has(index)) {
  if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= activationTime && 
      elapsedSinceCycleStart < nextActivationTime) {
    providerActivationStates.value.add(index)
    busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
  }
}

// Reset on cycle complete
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= cycleDurationMs) {
  providerActivationStates.value.clear()
  // ... rest of reset
}
```

**Benefit**: Prevents 70 emissions → 1 emission per provider per cycle.
**Risk**: None - children already handle duplicates via clearTimeouts().

---

**Improvement 2: Use createRafControls (10 min effort)**
```typescript
import { createRafControls } from '@animations/composables/useAnimation/rafCoordinator'

const orchestrationRaf = createRafControls(({ timestamp }) => {
  // Move animateLoop logic here
  if (!animation.canAnimate.value || !isVisible.value) {
    orchestrationRaf.pause()
    return
  }
  
  // ... existing animateLoop logic ...
}, { immediate: false })

// Simplify lifecycle
const orchestrateAnimation = () => {
  clearOrchestration()
  if (!animation.canAnimate.value || !isVisible.value) return
  
  isPlaying.value = true
  emit('animationStart', 'orchestration')
  
  animationStartTime = performance.now()
  currentCycleStartTime = animationStartTime
  currentCycleIndex = 0
  
  orchestrationRaf.resume()  // Simpler than managing animationFrameId
}

const stopAnimation = () => {
  isPlaying.value = false
  orchestrationRaf.pause()
  busEmitSafe('stop-all', undefined, { force: true })
}
```

**Benefit**: Reuses RAF coordinator from useAnimation (consistency).
**Risk**: None - same RAF loop, cleaner API.

---

**Improvement 3: Add Debug Logging (5 min effort)**
```typescript
const DEBUG = import.meta.env.DEV

if (DEBUG && elapsedSinceCycleStart >= activationTime && 
    elapsedSinceCycleStart < nextActivationTime && 
    !providerActivationStates.value.has(index)) {
  console.log(`[Conductor] Activating pathway ${index} (${provider}) at ${elapsedSinceCycleStart.toFixed(0)}ms`)
}

// On cycle complete
if (DEBUG && elapsedSinceCycleStart >= cycleDurationMs) {
  console.log(`[Conductor] Cycle ${currentCycleIndex} complete at ${elapsedSinceStart.toFixed(0)}ms (duration: ${elapsedSinceCycleStart.toFixed(0)}ms)`)
}
```

**Benefit**: Easy debugging of timing issues in dev mode.
**Risk**: None - dev-only logging.

---

**When to RECONSIDER timeline:**

1. **If requirements change to:**
   - Need to pause/resume with preserved timing offsets
   - Need timeline scrubbing (seek to 50% through cycle)
   - Need to run N cycles then stop (finite loop)
   - Need per-phase progress bars (0-100% for each provider)

2. **If adding complex sub-choreography:**
   - Each provider has 5-step entrance sequence
   - Dependent phases (phase B waits for phase A completion)
   - Multiple independent timelines running simultaneously

3. **If performance becomes an issue:**
   - Timeline's RAF coordinator might be more optimized
   - Need budget enforcement per-phase
   - Need FPS monitoring per animation

**None of these apply to current use case.**

---

**SUMMARY**

**Current Manual RAF: KEEP IT** ✅
- Simple, clear, debuggable
- Perfect fit for infinite ambient loop
- Handles dynamic changes seamlessly
- Event-driven architecture
- Minor improvements available (state tracking)

**Timeline Plugin: DON'T USE** ❌
- Overengineered for this use case
- Creates regression risks (dynamic behavior)
- Adds wrapper boilerplate (event emission)
- No compelling benefits for infinite loops
- Better suited for finite, complex sequences

**Recommended Action:**
1. Add state tracking to prevent duplicate emissions (5 min)
2. Use createRafControls for cleaner API (10 min)
3. Add debug logging for development (5 min)
4. Document RAF loop logic with comments (10 min)

**Total effort: 30 minutes** to improve current implementation.

vs.

**Timeline migration: 2-3 days** with significant regression risk and no benefit.   │

│ **Planning State Tracking Implementation**

Let me identify all the places that need changes:

**1. Where to declare state:**
- After line 348 (after clearOrchestration function)
- Before orchestrateAnimation function
- Use plain JavaScript (no refs needed - not reactive state)

**2. State variables needed:**
- `activatedProviders` - Set<number> to track provider indices
- `bubbleActivated` - boolean to track if bubble cycle has fired

**3. Where to CHECK state (prevent duplicates):**
- Line 420: Rotation mode pathway activation
- Line 427: Unison mode pathway activation  
- Line 433: Bubble cycle activation

**4. Where to SET state (mark as activated):**
- Same locations as CHECK - after check passes

**5. Where to RESET state (clear for new cycle):**
- Line 438-443: Cycle completion block
- Line 350-358: clearOrchestration function
- Line 451-456: stopAnimation function

**6. Edge cases to handle:**
- Mode switching mid-cycle: Let current cycle complete, state clears naturally at cycle boundary
- Provider count changes: Let current cycle complete, state clears at boundary
- Stop then restart: clearOrchestration resets state
- Component unmount: stopAnimation resets state

**7. Testing points:**
- Rotation mode: Provider should activate exactly once during its window
- Unison mode: All providers should activate exactly once at cycle start
- Bubble: Should fire exactly once at cycle start
- Cycle reset: State should clear and allow new activations
- Multiple cycles: Should work consistently cycle after cycle   │

│ **Reading Current Code for Exact Context**

Let me trace the exact flow and line numbers:

**Current activation flow in rotation mode (line 408-422):**
```typescript
if (currentMode.value === 'rotation') {
  const providerCount = validatedProviders.value.length
  const timePerProvider = cycleDurationMs / providerCount

  validatedProviders.value.forEach((provider, index) => {
    const activationTime = index * timePerProvider
    const nextActivationTime = (index + 1) * timePerProvider

    // Activate if current time is within the activation window for this cycle
    if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= activationTime && elapsedSinceCycleStart < nextActivationTime) {
      // To avoid re-triggering within the same cycle, we need a more robust check
      // For now, we'll rely on the bus to handle de-duplication or quick animation
      busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
    }
  })
}
```

Comment on line 418: "To avoid re-triggering within the same cycle, we need a more robust check"
This is EXACTLY what we're fixing!

**Current activation flow in unison mode (line 424-430):**
```typescript
else { // Unison mode
  // For unison, activate all at the start of the cycle
  if (elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) { // Trigger once at the very beginning of the cycle
    validatedProviders.value.forEach((provider, index) => {
      busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'unison' })
    })
  }
}
```

The `< 50ms` check tries to prevent duplicates but still allows multiple frames within 50ms window!
At 60fps, ~3 frames occur in 50ms, so 3x emissions for each provider.

**Bubble cycle (line 433-435):**
```typescript
if (props.showConductorCommand && elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) { // Trigger once at cycle start
  busEmitSafe('bubble-cycle-start')
}
```

Same issue - 3x emissions in first 50ms.

**Cycle completion (line 438-443):**
```typescript
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= cycleDurationMs) {
  currentCycleStartTime = currentTime
  currentCycleIndex++
  emit('animationComplete', 'orchestration')
  emit('animationStart', 'orchestration') // Start next cycle
}
```

This is where we need to clear state.

**clearOrchestration (line 350-358):**
```typescript
const clearOrchestration = () => {
  if (animationFrameId) {
    cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameId)
    animationFrameId = null
  }
  animationStartTime = null
  currentCycleStartTime = null
  currentCycleIndex = 0
}
```

Need to add state reset here.

**stopAnimation (line 451-456):**
```typescript
const stopAnimation = () => {
  isPlaying.value = false
  hasScheduledRestart.value = false
  clearOrchestration()
  busEmitSafe('stop-all', undefined, { force: true })
}
```

Calls clearOrchestration, so state will be reset there.   │

│ **Implementation Plan - Exact Changes**

**Change 1: Declare state variables (after line 348)**

Add after `let currentCycleIndex = 0`:
```typescript
// Activation state tracking to prevent duplicate emissions within a cycle
let activatedProviders = new Set<number>()
let bubbleCycleActivated = false
```

**Change 2: Update clearOrchestration (line 350-358)**

Replace:
```typescript
const clearOrchestration = () => {
  if (animationFrameId) {
    cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameId)
    animationFrameId = null
  }
  animationStartTime = null
  currentCycleStartTime = null
  currentCycleIndex = 0
}
```

With:
```typescript
const clearOrchestration = () => {
  if (animationFrameId) {
    cancelAnimationFrame(animationFrameId)
    animationFrameId = null
  }
  animationStartTime = null
  currentCycleStartTime = null
  currentCycleIndex = 0
  // Reset activation state
  activatedProviders.clear()
  bubbleCycleActivated = false
}
```

**Change 3: Update rotation mode activation (line 408-422)**

Replace:
```typescript
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= activationTime && elapsedSinceCycleStart < nextActivationTime) {
  // To avoid re-triggering within the same cycle, we need a more robust check
  // For now, we'll rely on the bus to handle de-duplication or quick animation
  busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
}
```

With:
```typescript
if (!activatedProviders.has(index) &&
    elapsedSinceCycleStart >= activationTime && 
    elapsedSinceCycleStart < nextActivationTime) {
  activatedProviders.add(index)
  busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'rotation' })
}
```

**Change 4: Update unison mode activation (line 424-430)**

Replace:
```typescript
} else { // Unison mode
  // For unison, activate all at the start of the cycle
  if (elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) { // Trigger once at the very beginning of the cycle
    validatedProviders.value.forEach((provider, index) => {
      busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'unison' })
    })
  }
}
```

With:
```typescript
} else { // Unison mode
  // For unison, activate all at the start of the cycle
  if (elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) {
    validatedProviders.value.forEach((provider, index) => {
      if (!activatedProviders.has(index)) {
        activatedProviders.add(index)
        busEmitSafe('pathway-activate', { index, provider, delay: 0, mode: 'unison' })
      }
    })
  }
}
```

**Change 5: Update bubble cycle activation (line 433-435)**

Replace:
```typescript
if (props.showConductorCommand && elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) { // Trigger once at cycle start
  busEmitSafe('bubble-cycle-start')
}
```

With:
```typescript
if (props.showConductorCommand && !bubbleCycleActivated && elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50) {
  bubbleCycleActivated = true
  busEmitSafe('bubble-cycle-start')
}
```

**Change 6: Update cycle completion (line 438-443)**

Replace:
```typescript
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= cycleDurationMs) {
  currentCycleStartTime = currentTime
  currentCycleIndex++
  emit('animationComplete', 'orchestration')
  emit('animationStart', 'orchestration') // Start next cycle
}
```

With:
```typescript
if (elapsedSinceCycleStart >= cycleDurationMs) {
  // Reset activation state for next cycle
  activatedProviders.clear()
  bubbleCycleActivated = false
  
  currentCycleStartTime = currentTime
  currentCycleIndex++
  emit('animationComplete', 'orchestration')
  emit('animationStart', 'orchestration') // Start next cycle
}
```

**Verification checklist:**
- ✅ Variables declared with correct types
- ✅ State cleared in clearOrchestration (handles stop/restart)
- ✅ State cleared at cycle completion (handles normal flow)
- ✅ Rotation mode checks state before activating
- ✅ Unison mode checks state before activating
- ✅ Bubble checks state before activating
- ✅ All activations mark state after check passes
- ✅ No race conditions (all checks/sets happen synchronously in RAF loop)   │

│ **Edge Case Verification**

**Edge Case 1: Provider count changes mid-cycle**
Scenario: 3 providers → animation running → change to 6 providers

Current state: `activatedProviders = Set([0, 1])` (providers 0, 1 already activated)
New provider list: [instagram, facebook, threads, linkedin, tiktok, youtube] (6 providers)

What happens:
- Providers 0-2 won't re-activate (already in Set) ✅
- Providers 3-5 will activate when their windows arrive ✅
- At cycle completion, Set clears ✅
- Next cycle: All 6 providers activate normally ✅

**Verdict: Safe** - Set size doesn't matter, we check by index

---

**Edge Case 2: Mode change mid-cycle**
Scenario: Rotation mode → mid-cycle → switch to Unison mode

Current state: `activatedProviders = Set([0, 1, 2])` (3 activated in rotation)
Mode switches to unison at 4000ms into cycle

What happens:
- Next frame checks `if (elapsedSinceCycleStart < 50)` → false (we're at 4000ms) ✅
- Unison mode providers DON'T activate mid-cycle ✅
- At cycle completion (7000ms), Set clears ✅
- Next cycle: All providers activate at 0ms (unison mode) ✅

**Verdict: Safe** - Unison mode only activates in first 50ms, so mid-cycle switch is ignored

**Alternative scenario: Switch FROM unison TO rotation mid-cycle**
Current state: `activatedProviders = Set([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` (all activated at 0ms in unison)
Mode switches to rotation at 4000ms

What happens:
- Rotation mode checks windows for each provider
- Provider 3's window is 3500-4666ms, we're at 4000ms ✅
- But provider 3 is already in Set → won't activate ✅
- Providers 4, 5 windows haven't arrived yet, and they're in Set → won't activate ✅
- At cycle completion, Set clears ✅
- Next cycle: Providers activate in rotation windows ✅

**Verdict: Safe** - Mode switch mid-cycle doesn't cause duplicate activations

---

**Edge Case 3: Stop animation then restart**
Scenario: Animation playing → stop() → play again

What happens:
- `stopAnimation()` calls `clearOrchestration()` ✅
- `clearOrchestration()` clears Set and resets boolean ✅
- New `orchestrateAnimation()` starts fresh ✅

**Verdict: Safe** - State properly reset

---

**Edge Case 4: Component unmount during animation**
Scenario: Animation playing → component unmounts

What happens:
- `onUnmounted()` hook calls `stopAnimation()` (line 550) ✅
- `stopAnimation()` calls `clearOrchestration()` ✅
- RAF cancelled, state cleared ✅

**Verdict: Safe** - Proper cleanup

---

**Edge Case 5: Very fast cycles (< 50ms)**
Scenario: `cycleDuration = 0.02` (20ms cycle)

What happens:
- Frame 1 (0ms): All providers activate (unison check `< 50ms` is true)
- Frame 2 (16ms): Cycle hasn't completed yet (16 < 20)
  - Unison check still true (`< 50ms`)
  - But providers in Set → won't re-activate ✅
- Frame 3 (32ms): Cycle completed (32 > 20)
  - Set clears ✅
  - Next cycle starts, providers activate again ✅

**Verdict: Safe** - State tracking handles fast cycles

---

**Edge Case 6: Floating element exit/enter during cycle**
Scenario: Animation at 3000ms → FloatingElement exit starts

What happens:
- `handleFloatingElementStart('exit')` calls `stopAnimation()` (line 464) ✅
- `stopAnimation()` clears state via `clearOrchestration()` ✅
- When float completes, `handleFloatingElementComplete('enter')` calls `orchestrateAnimation()` ✅
- Fresh state, new cycle starts ✅

**Verdict: Safe** - Proper integration with floating element

│ **Final Implementation Steps**

I've verified all edge cases pass. Now I'll implement the changes:

**Summary of changes:**
1. Add 2 state tracking variables after line 348
2. Update clearOrchestration to reset state (line 350-358)
3. Add state check to rotation mode (line 416-421)
4. Add state check to unison mode (line 426-429)
5. Add state check to bubble cycle (line 433)
6. Clear state at cycle completion (line 438)

**Expected impact:**
- Rotation mode: 70 emissions per provider → 1 emission
- Unison mode: 3 emissions per provider → 1 emission
- Bubble: 3 emissions → 1 emission
- Total: ~420 events/cycle → 7 events/cycle (98.3% reduction)

**Safety:**
- All edge cases verified
- No breaking changes
- Children already handle duplicates (defensive)
- Pure optimization - semantic correctness improvement

Let me proceed with the implementation.
