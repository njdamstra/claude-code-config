[GMCPT] [1762295844189] Starting: gemini "-p" "Analyze these research findings and synthesize best practices for:

1. Investigation/Research/Advice workflows - for brainstorming and decision-making
2. Plan Writing workflows - for detailed implementation planning

KEY FINDINGS:

From Tavily search on Claude Code workflow patterns:
- Article: "I mastered the Claude Code workflow" emphasizes problem preparation, context management, iteration
- Best practice: Use AI to read docs FIRST before implementation
- Flow-based architecture with distinct nodes for decision-making, file operations, analysis
- Make AI assistant read docs before jumping into implementation
- Spec-Driven Development: Use planning tools to consolidate spec + plan + tasks + context

From SDLC best practices:
- 6 systematic phases: planning, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance
- Engineering documentation reduces onboarding time and cognitive load
- Checkpointing and resuming workflows for long-running processes
- User approval points at key milestones

From AI assistant investigation patterns:
- Problem decomposition is critical
- Context windows constrain code processing
- Stateless nature means they forget previous interactions
- "Context rot" causes loss of important details
- Key strategies: domain knowledge, problem decomposition, critical review, context management, test-driven development, incremental refinement

EXISTING WORKFLOW SYSTEM:
- YAML-based workflows with phases, subagent_matrix, gap_checks, checkpoints
- Phases are reusable templates (5-step structure: Spawn → Wait → Read → Gap Check → Checkpoint)
- Subagents spawned in parallel using Task tool
- Human-in-loop approval points with file reviews
- Conditional subagent spawning based on --frontend/--backend/--both flags
- Anti-hallucination checks in gap criteria

USER'S DRAFT PLAN:
**Investigation Workflow Phases:**
1. Problem Understanding (STOP & ASK)
2. Codebase Investigation (optional subagent)
3. External Research (call external-research skill)
4. Solution Synthesis (STOP & ASK)
5. Approach Refinement (Repeatable)

**Plan Writing Workflow Phases:**
1. Plan Initialization (STOP & ASK)
2. Requirements Documentation
3. Technical Design (optional architecture subagent)
4. Implementation Breakdown
5. Testing Strategy
6. Quality Checklist (STOP & ASK)
7. Plan Finalization (Repeatable)

INTEGRATION PATTERN:
Investigation Workflow → [90% confidence] → Plan Writing Workflow

Create 3 DISTINCT approaches with different philosophies:
- Approach 1: Minimal (fast, few subagents, focus on speed)
- Approach 2: Balanced (moderate subagents, good checkpoints, balanced depth)
- Approach 3: Comprehensive (thorough research, many subagents, deep analysis)

For EACH approach, provide:
1. Workflow philosophy/tradeoffs
2. Phase breakdown with specific focus areas
3. Subagent orchestration strategy (which agents, when to spawn)
4. Checkpoint placement (when to ask user)
5. Gap check strategy (what to verify)
6. Deliverable structure (what files to generate)
7. Estimated time and token usage

Format as structured comparison that can be presented to user for decision-making."
