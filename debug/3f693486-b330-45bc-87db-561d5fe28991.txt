Frontend workflow schemas and node configurations\n2. Action node library and available node types\n3. Connection field mechanics (adding/reordering/deleting nodes)\n4. Condition and multi-condition creation and storage\n5. Variable storage in workflow configurations\n6. WorkflowManager expectations for:\n   - Scheduling\n   - Conditions and multiconditions\n   - Actions and AI actions\n   - Connections\n   - Node configurations\n\nAGENT NAVIGATION INSTRUCTIONS:\n- For frontend research: cd /Users/natedamstra/socialaize-fullstack/automation-imp/frontend/src/\n- For WorkflowManager research: cd /Users/natedamstra/socialaize-fullstack/automation-imp/functions/WorkflowManager/functions/WorkflowManager/\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1.
