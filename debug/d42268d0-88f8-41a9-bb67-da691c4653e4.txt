│ I need to complete Phase 1 deliverables and then implement Phase 2. Let me break down what's missing from Phase 1:

Phase 1 Design (completed - we have design docs):
- YAML_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md ✓
- PHASE_MODULE_DESIGN.md ✓
- SUBAGENT_TEMPLATE_DESIGN.md ✓
- SCRIPT_ARCHITECTURE.md ✓

Phase 1 Deliverables (NOT completed - need actual files):
- Task 1.1: 5 workflow YAML files (new-feature, refactoring, debugging, improving, quick)
- Task 1.3: 3 example subagent templates (codebase-scanner, pattern-analyzer, user-story-writer for new-feature workflow)

So Phase 1 is actually incomplete. I need to create the actual files based on the designs.   │

   - use-workflows-v2/subagents/user-story-writer/

   - new-feature.yaml (most comprehensive example in the design)
   - refactoring.yaml
   - debugging.yaml
   - improving.yaml
   - quick.yaml

   - pattern-analyzer/new-feature.md.tmpl
   - user-story-writer/new-feature.md.tmpl

4. Create codebase-scanner/new-feature.md.tmpl (from SUBAGENT_TEMPLATE_DESIGN.md lines 624-728)
5. Create pattern-analyzer/new-feature.md.tmpl (from lines 730-838)
6. Create user-story-writer/new-feature.md.tmpl (from lines 840-949)

7. Create lib/workflow-parser.sh
8. Create lib/scope-detector.sh
9. Create lib/subagent-matcher.sh
10. Create lib/template-renderer.sh

│ Potential issues to watch for:

1. The workflow YAMLs need to be properly formatted and valid YAML
2. The subagent templates use Mustache-style variables ({{variable}}) - need to preserve these exactly
3. The bash scripts need proper error handling and dependency checks (yq, jq)
4. File paths need to be relative to the skill directory

Verification steps:
- After creating YAMLs: Validate with yq
- After creating templates: Check that {{variables}} are preserved
- After creating bash libs: Test functions independently
- After creating main script: Test with --help flag first, then actual execution

Dependencies needed:
- yq (YAML parser)
- jq (JSON processor)
- bash 4+

│ For the 4 additional workflow YAMLs (refactoring, debugging, improving, quick), I need to adapt the structure from new-feature.yaml. Each will have different:

1. phases array (debugging might have: reproduction, analysis, root-cause, solution, validation)
2. subagent_matrix (debugging needs bug-reproducer, root-cause-tracer instead of user-story-writer)
3. gap_checks (different criteria per workflow type)
4. checkpoints (different approval points)

I should check if the design docs mention these other workflows' structures... Let me recall:
- The YAML_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md focuses on new-feature as the primary example
- I'll need to infer reasonable structures for the other workflows based on the patterns

This might be where I need to be creative while staying consistent with the schema.   │

│ Final execution plan:

Phase 1 Completion:
1. Create directory structure (mkdir -p for workflows/, subagents/{codebase-scanner,pattern-analyzer,user-story-writer}/)
2. Create new-feature.yaml (extract from design doc)
3. Create 4 other workflow YAMLs (create reasonable structures based on schema)
4. Create 3 subagent templates (extract from design doc)
5. Validate with yq

Phase 2.1 & 2.2:
6. Create lib/ directory
7. Create lib/workflow-parser.sh (extract from architecture doc)
8. Create lib/scope-detector.sh (extract from architecture doc)
9. Create lib/subagent-matcher.sh (extract from architecture doc)
10. Create lib/template-renderer.sh (extract from architecture doc)
11. Make all .sh files executable

Phase 2.3:
12. Create generate-workflow-instructions.sh (extract from architecture doc)
13. Make executable
14. Test --help
15. Test with new-feature workflow

I'll create a TodoWrite list with these tasks and execute in batches. Ready to proceed.   │

Solution: Create a minimal registry.yaml now with the 3 subagents I have templates for:
- codebase-scanner
- pattern-analyzer  
- user-story-writer

This will allow Phase 2.3 testing to work. I can expand the registry in Phase 6.2 with all remaining subagents.

The registry should map each subagent to:
- task_agent_type (for Task tool)
- thoroughness (quick|medium|thorough)
- description
- deliverable (output path template)

I'll create a minimal version now.   │

The main script (generate-workflow-instructions.sh) is documented in SCRIPT_ARCHITECTURE.md lines 681-928. It's the orchestrator that:

1. Sources all 4 library files
2. Defines helper functions (usage, build_phase_data)
3. Implements main() function:
   - Parse args (workflow, feature-name, flags)
   - Load workflow YAML
   - Detect scope
   - Output header with metadata
   - Loop through phases and render each one
   - Output finalization section

The script is ~250 lines and fully implemented in the design doc. I can extract it directly.   │

│ Potential issues to watch for:

1. Phase module templates don't exist yet - that's Phase 3. The script will try to render phases/discovery.md etc. but those files don't exist.
   - Solution: The script should gracefully handle missing phase templates with a warning (which it does per line 863-866)
   - This means testing will show warnings, but that's expected

2. Template variable substitution might not work perfectly on first try
   - The template-renderer.sh uses perl for regex which might not be available
   - If perl is missing, conditionals won't work
   - I should test if perl is available first

3. The build_phase_data function needs to construct complex JSON which could fail
   - Uses jq which should be available (we validated YAMLs with yq earlier)

Actually, looking more carefully - I need phase template files for this to work properly. But the plan says Phase 3 is "Create Phase Modules". Should I create at least one phase module now for testing, or accept warnings?

Decision: Accept warnings for now. The test will validate the script logic, and Phase 3 will add the phase modules.   │

│ Phase 3: Create Phase Modules

I need to create 5 phase template files. Each one follows a similar structure but with phase-specific content:

1. phases/discovery.md - Find existing patterns and architecture
2. phases/requirements.md - Write user stories and technical requirements
3. phases/design.md - Design architecture and implementation approach
4. phases/synthesis.md - Combine all findings into cohesive plan (no subagents, just main agent)
5. phases/validation.md - Validate feasibility and completeness

The PHASE_MODULE_DESIGN.md has a complete discovery.md example at lines 520-663. This provides the exact template structure I should follow.

Key template variables each phase needs:
- {{phase_name}}
- {{feature_name}}
- {{workflow}}
- {{scope}}
- {{output_dir}}
- {{#subagents}} array with: index, name, type, task_agent_type, thoroughness, task_description, deliverable_filename
- {{subagent_count}}
- {{#gap_criteria}} array
- {{#gap_options}} array
- {{#checkpoint}} object (conditional)
- {{#deliverables}} array   │

- Purpose: Scan codebase for patterns
- Subagents: codebase-scanner, pattern-analyzer, dependency-mapper, frontend-scanner, backend-scanner
- Output: JSON files with patterns, conventions, architecture
- Checkpoint: Yes - review findings before requirements

**Requirements Phase:**
- Purpose: Define user stories and technical requirements
- Reads discovery outputs as context
- Subagents: user-story-writer, technical-requirements-analyzer, edge-case-identifier
- Output: User stories (markdown), technical requirements (JSON), edge cases (JSON)
- Checkpoint: Optional

**Design Phase:**
- Purpose: Design architecture and implementation approach
- Reads discovery + requirements outputs
- Subagents: architecture-designer, implementation-sequencer, test-strategy-planner, ui-designer, api-designer
- Output: Architecture design (markdown), implementation sequence (markdown), test strategy (markdown)
- Checkpoint: Optional

**Synthesis Phase:**
- Purpose: Main agent combines all findings into final plan
- NO subagents - this is main agent work
- Reads all previous phase outputs
- Follows template structure
- Output: synthesis.md (comprehensive plan)
- Checkpoint: No

**Validation Phase:**
- Purpose: Check feasibility and completeness
- Subagents: feasibility-validator, completeness-checker
- Output: Validation reports (JSON)
- Checkpoint: Yes - final approval before implementation   │

│ Synthesis phase is unique:

It has NO subagents. Instead, the main agent (Claude in the main conversation) does the work directly.

The synthesis phase module should:
1. Instruct Claude to read all previous phase outputs
2. List which files to read from each phase
3. Provide structure/template for the synthesis document
4. Guide Claude on how to combine findings
5. Specify output format and completeness criteria

Since there are no subagents, the template structure will be different:
- No "Step 1: Spawn Subagents"
- Instead: "Step 1: Read All Phase Outputs"
- "Step 2: Synthesize Findings"
- "Step 3: Generate Plan Document"
- "Step 4: Self-Review"
- No gap check (that comes in validation phase)
- No checkpoint (proceeds directly to validation)

The {{#subagents}} block will be empty, so I need conditional rendering:
{{^subagents}}
## Step 1: Read All Phase Outputs

│ Implementation approach:

I'll create all 5 phase modules in a single batch. Each will be 150-250 lines of markdown with Mustache variables.

Order of creation:
1. discovery.md - Use the example from PHASE_MODULE_DESIGN.md as base
2. requirements.md - Adapt discovery structure, change context and subagents
3. design.md - Similar structure, different subagents and context
4. synthesis.md - Special structure (no subagents, main agent instructions)
5. validation.md - Back to standard structure, minimal subagents

After creating all 5, I'll test the generator again to see the full workflow instructions rendered with actual phase content instead of warnings.

Expected outcome: Full workflow instructions with all phases properly rendered, showing complete step-by-step process for Claude to follow.   │

│ Batch 4 execution plan:

1. Update todo list (mark phase 3 tasks as in_progress)
2. Create phases/discovery.md (extract/adapt from PHASE_MODULE_DESIGN.md)
3. Create phases/requirements.md 
4. Create phases/design.md
5. Create phases/synthesis.md (special case - no subagents)
6. Create phases/validation.md
7. Test generator again with new-feature workflow
8. Verify complete instructions are generated
9. Mark all tasks complete

The templates use Mustache syntax which our template-renderer.sh can handle (mostly - arrays might need refinement but basic vars and conditionals work).

Testing will show if the template rendering works correctly. If not, I may need to adjust template-renderer.sh further.   │

│ Let me think about what happens when the user restarts Claude and tries to use this skill:

1. User would invoke the skill (presumably via a SKILL.md that doesn't exist yet)
2. The skill would need to run the generator script
3. The generator would output workflow instructions
4. Claude would need to follow those instructions

Current state check:
- ✅ Generator script exists and works
- ✅ Workflow YAMLs exist (5 of them)
- ✅ Subagent registry exists
- ✅ 5 phase templates exist
- ⚠️ Template rendering has issues with arrays
- ❌ SKILL.md doesn't exist (Phase 5 deliverable)
- ❌ Only 3 subagent templates exist (need ~20 more for all workflows)

What would actually happen:
1. No SKILL.md means skill can't be invoked properly
2. Even if they run the script manually, synthesis phase works but discovery/requirements/design/validation have rendering errors
3. The subagent templates for discovery phase exist (codebase-scanner, pattern-analyzer, user-story-writer)
4. But the instructions would be garbled due to array iteration issues

So the answer is: **Not quite yet**. The synthesis phase would work perfectly, but the other phases have rendering issues that would confuse Claude.   │

│ What's needed to make this usable NOW:

Option 1: Fix template rendering
- The sed error is from trying to substitute multi-line JSON with newlines
- The issue is in substitute_simple_vars() - it's trying to replace {{.}} with complex JSON
- This happens when we try to substitute array iteration variables
- We're not actually handling {{#array}} blocks properly

Option 2: Create SKILL.md that bypasses the broken parts
- Make a SKILL.md that just uses the synthesis phase
- Or create a simpler workflow that only uses synthesis
- This could work as an MVP

Option 3: Simplify the phase templates
- Remove array iteration for now
- Use static instructions instead of dynamic lists
- This would make them work immediately but less flexible

The user wants to know: "Can I use this NOW?"

Most honest answer: The synthesis phase works perfectly. The other phases need either:
1. Template rendering fixes (complex)
2. Simplified templates without arrays (quick)
3. Manual instructions instead of generated (quick)

For immediate usability, I should create a SKILL.md that works with the current state.   │

│ Best immediate solution:

Create a SKILL.md that:
1. Explains what use-workflows-v2 does
2. Shows how to run the generator script manually
3. Notes which parts work (synthesis) vs. which need refinement (array iteration in other phases)
4. Provides a quick workaround: Generate the workflow, then manually interpret the discovery/requirements/design phases

Or even better:
Create a working MVP by simplifying those 4 phase templates to remove array iteration. Replace with static placeholders that still guide Claude but don't require complex rendering.

Actually, the synthesis phase alone is very valuable! It shows the complete structure. And the discovery/requirements/design phases DO render - they just have some garbled sections around arrays. The core instructions are still readable.

So truthfully: **Yes, with caveats**. 
- Synthesis phase: fully functional
- Other phases: 70% functional (static content works, dynamic arrays need manual interpretation)
- The workflow would be followable by a human Claude reading it, just not perfectly clean

I should be honest with the user about current state and offer to either:
1. Create a SKILL.md for current state
2. Fix the template rendering
3. Both   │

│ I need to fix the template rendering issue and create SKILL.md.

The problem is in template-renderer.sh. The sed error "unescaped newline inside substitute pattern" happens because:

1. We're trying to substitute {{.}} which is used inside array iteration blocks
2. The substitute_simple_vars() function tries to replace {{.}} with a complex JSON object that contains newlines
3. sed can't handle multi-line replacement in a simple s/// command

The issue is that we're calling substitute_simple_vars() AFTER we should have processed arrays, but our substitute_arrays() function doesn't actually work - it just returns the input unchanged.

Real solution:
- Implement proper array iteration in substitute_arrays()
- OR remove the {{.}} pattern from simple var substitution (it's special for array iteration)
- OR use a different approach entirely

Looking at the templates, the array iteration blocks like:
```
{{#subagents}}
  {{index}}. {{name}}
{{/subagents}}
```

This needs to iterate over the subagents array and for each item, replace {{index}}, {{name}}, etc. with that item's properties.

The current substitute_arrays() function is a stub. I need to implement it properly using jq to iterate.   │

│ Implementation strategy for fixing template rendering:

The substitute_arrays() function needs to:
1. Find all {{#arrayname}}...{{/arrayname}} blocks
2. For each block, check if arrayname is an array in the JSON
3. If it is an array, iterate through each element
4. For each element, replace {{propertyname}} with the element's property value
5. Concatenate all iterations
6. Replace the entire {{#arrayname}}...{{/arrayname}} block with the concatenated result

This is complex in bash. But I can use a combination of:
- perl to extract block content (already using perl for conditionals)
- jq to iterate the array
- bash loop to build up the result

Here's the approach:
1. Extract the array block using perl regex
2. Get array length from jq
3. Loop through array indices
4. For each index, get the element as JSON
5. Replace variables in the block template with element properties
6. Concatenate results
7. Replace original block with result

This is still complex. Let me think of a simpler approach...   │

│ Simpler approach using mustache or similar:

Actually, there's a bash mustache implementation available. But we don't want external dependencies.

Even simpler: Use jq to do the template rendering entirely!

jq has string interpolation and can iterate arrays. We could:
1. Load template as a string
2. Use jq to process it with the data JSON
3. jq can iterate arrays and substitute variables

But that would be a major rewrite.

Pragmatic approach:
Since we're already using perl for conditionals, let's use perl for array iteration too. Perl can:
- Parse JSON (with JSON module, but we have jq)
- Do regex and string manipulation
- Handle multi-line content

Hybrid approach:
1. Use jq to detect arrays and get their data
2. Use perl to extract and repeat block content
3. Use bash/jq to substitute variables in each iteration
4. Assemble the result

Let me write a working substitute_arrays() function that handles the specific case we need:
- Input: template content, JSON data
- Find {{#arrayname}}...{{/arrayname}} blocks
- For each block, expand it by iterating the array   │

│ Actually, let me check what the actual error is more carefully:

The error is: `sed: 1: "s/{{.}}/{..."` 

This means it's trying to do: `sed 's/{{.}}/[big JSON blob]/'`

The {{.}} pattern is special in Mustache - it means "current item" when iterating arrays. For example:
```
{{#gap_criteria}}
- [ ] {{.}}
{{/gap_criteria}}
```

This should iterate gap_criteria array and for each string item, output "- [ ] {item}".

The problem: Our substitute_simple_vars() is trying to replace {{.}} as if it's a simple variable, looking for a field named "." in the JSON, and finding the entire JSON object, then trying to sed it with newlines.

Quick fix: Don't try to substitute {{.}} in substitute_simple_vars(). Skip it.

Then implement substitute_arrays() to handle {{#array}}{{.}}{{/array}} patterns specifically.

For arrays of objects like {{#subagents}}{{name}}{{/subagents}}, we need to substitute property names.
For arrays of primitives like {{#gap_criteria}}{{.}}{{/gap_criteria}}, we need to substitute the whole item.

This is getting complex. Let me implement a working version step by step.   │

- Add a filter to exclude the {{.}} pattern
- This prevents the sed error

Task 2: Implement substitute_arrays to handle array iteration

- For each array in the JSON, expand the block once per element
- Handle both {{.}} (primitive values) and {{property}} (object properties)

Task 3: Ensure correct processing order in render_template
- Arrays first (most specific)

Batch: Fix Template Rendering + Create SKILL.md

1. Update TodoWrite with new tasks
2. Fix substitute_simple_vars to exclude {{.}}
3. Implement proper substitute_arrays function
4. Test with discovery phase (should work now)
5. Test full new-feature workflow
6. Create SKILL.md with proper frontmatter
7. Test skill invocation
8. Mark all complete

This should take about 1-2 hours of work but I can do it efficiently by:
- Using a working Mustache-style array iteration algorithm
- Testing incrementally
- Creating comprehensive SKILL.md
