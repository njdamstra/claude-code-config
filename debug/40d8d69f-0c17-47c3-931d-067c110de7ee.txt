│ Based on the research, the optimal architecture is clear:
- Create 7 new components following existing theater/stage patterns
- Reuse SocialIcon.vue, FlyingObject.vue, UnifiedGrid patterns
- Use VueUse's useDraggable (proven in FloatingPanel.vue)
- CSS Grid with dynamic column sizing via CSS custom properties
- Mobile: stack vertically, no divider interaction

This follows existing patterns perfectly and minimizes custom code.   │

- Divider behavior (snap vs smooth)
- Animation intensity on left side (subtle chaos vs extreme chaos)
- Interaction level on right side (static demo vs clickable button)
- Visual labels ("Before/After" or "Manual/Automated")

│ MAJOR CORRECTION: User wants Row 1 to match Row 3's layout - two separate FeatureCards side by side in a grid, NOT a single card with draggable divider. Much simpler:
- LEFT FeatureCard: "Manual Chaos" theater (multiple tabs, bouncing icons)
- RIGHT FeatureCard: "Automated Workflow" theater (single unified card with "Publish All")
- Grid layout: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-[var(--spacing-16)]`
- Each card independent with its own teleport layer

This eliminates DraggableDivider, split-view stage, and complex orchestration.   │

│ Final plan summary:
- Create ManualChaosTheater.vue (left card) - 3-4 browser tabs with platform icons bouncing chaotically
- Create AutomatedWorkflowTheater.vue (right card) - single unified card with calm "Publish All" button
- Update WorkflowsSection.vue Row 1 to use grid layout: `grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-[var(--spacing-16)]`
- Each theater gets own teleport layer (workflow-theater-layer-0-left, workflow-theater-layer-0-right)
- Reuse existing components: SocialIcon.vue, BrowserTabWindow (new), existing animation patterns

This is straightforward and follows existing patterns perfectly.   │
