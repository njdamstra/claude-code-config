│ First, I need to understand what was recently implemented. Looking at the git commits:
1. "Fix guest ticket creation authentication error" - suggests there was an auth issue with guest tickets
2. "Add comprehensive email notification system for support tickets" - email notifications were added
3. "Refactor guest ticket auth to use Web Crypto API for cross-platform compatibility" - they switched auth methods
4. "Replace jose dependency with Node.js built-in crypto module" - replaced JWT library

This tells me they're dealing with authentication for guest users who create support tickets. The progression shows they had issues and tried multiple approaches (jose → Web Crypto API → Node.js crypto).   │

2. How guest authentication works (guestTicketAuth.ts)
3. How the client-side interacts with the system (useSupportTickets.ts composable)
4. How authenticated users create tickets vs guests

│ From what I've read so far, I can see the pattern for guest tickets:

1. **Guest Ticket Creation Flow:**
   - Client calls `/api/support/create-guest-ticket` (server-side API route)
   - Server uses `AppwriteServer.withAdminKey()` to bypass auth requirements
   - Creates document directly in database
   - Generates a secure token using HMAC (guestTicketAuth.ts)
   - Sends email with tracking link

2. **Authenticated User Ticket Creation:**
   - Uses `createSupportTicket()` from the store
   - Requires user authentication

Now I need to compare this with existing patterns in the codebase to see if they're following established conventions. Let me check the supportTicketStore to understand how authenticated users create tickets.   │

│ I found a critical issue! Looking at the supportTicketStore.ts, there's a `createGuestSupportTicket()` method (lines 129-230) that's trying to create guest tickets using `this.create()` which is from BaseStore.

**Problem:** BaseStore's `create()` method uses the client-side Appwrite SDK, which requires authentication. Guest users don't have authentication, so this method will FAIL.

**The Dual Approach:**
1. In the store: `createGuestSupportTicket()` - tries to use BaseStore.create() (client-side, requires auth) ❌
2. In the API route: `/api/support/create-guest-ticket` - uses AppwriteServer.withAdminKey() (server-side, bypasses auth) ✅

The composable (`useSupportTickets.ts`) correctly uses the API route approach (line 262), but the store has a broken method that shouldn't exist.

Let me verify by checking how BaseStore works and looking at other stores for comparison.   │

│ Now I understand the established patterns in the codebase:

**Pattern 1: BaseStore (client-side database operations)**
- Uses client-side Appwrite SDK
- Requires user authentication
- Permissions are set per-document
- Example: `supportTicketStore.createSupportTicket()` with user permissions

**Pattern 2: Function Executions (client triggers server-side logic)**
- Uses `Functions.createExecution()` from client
- Serverless function runs with admin/function permissions
- Example: `emailStore.sendContactEmail()` creates execution of EmailHandler function

**Pattern 3: API Routes (server-side operations)**
- Client calls API route (fetch to `/api/...`)
- API route uses `AppwriteServer.withAdminKey()` for admin access
- Example: `/api/support/create-guest-ticket`

**THE PROBLEM:**
The `supportTicketStore.createGuestSupportTicket()` method (lines 129-230) is trying to use Pattern 1 (BaseStore.create) for guest tickets, but guests have NO authentication. This method CANNOT work because:
- BaseStore uses client-side SDK from `useAppwriteClient()`
- Client SDK requires an authenticated session
- Guest users have no session

**THE SOLUTION ALREADY IN PLACE:**
The composable correctly uses Pattern 3 (API route) to bypass this issue, but the store method is misleading/broken.

Let me verify by checking if there are any other approaches and looking at the guest reply functionality.   │

│ CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND in `/api/support/guest-reply.ts`:

Lines 28 and 62 are using:
- `supportTicketStore.store.get(payload.ticketId)` 
- `supportTicketStore.store.update(payload.ticketId, {...})`

These are BaseStore methods that run in the API route context. The problem is:
- BaseStore uses `useAppwriteClient()` which creates a client-side SDK instance
- In API routes (server-side), there's NO authenticated session
- These calls will FAIL with authentication errors

**This explains the user's errors!** The commits show:
- "Fix guest ticket creation authentication error"
- "Refactor guest ticket auth to use Web Crypto API"
- Multiple attempts to fix authentication issues

**CORRECT PATTERN for API routes:**
API routes should use `AppwriteServer.withAdminKey()` for ALL database operations, not BaseStore methods.

**Example from create-guest-ticket.ts (CORRECT):**
```typescript
const appwrite = AppwriteServer.withAdminKey();
const ticket = await appwrite.createDocument({...});
await appwrite.updateDocument({...});
```

**guest-reply.ts (INCORRECT):**
```typescript
await supportTicketStore.store.get(...)  // ❌ Uses client SDK, no auth
await supportTicketStore.store.update(...)  // ❌ Uses client SDK, no auth
```

Let me check the AppwriteServer implementation to confirm the correct pattern.   │

│ Found ANOTHER instance of the same error pattern in `src/pages/support/ticket/[token].astro` line 24:

```typescript
const result = await supportTicketStore.store.get(payload.ticketId);
```

This is running in Astro's server-side context (frontmatter), trying to use BaseStore.get() which requires authentication.

**Summary of Pattern Violations Found:**

1. **supportTicketStore.ts:129-230** - `createGuestSupportTicket()` method tries to use BaseStore.create() ❌
2. **src/pages/api/support/guest-reply.ts:28,62** - Uses BaseStore.get() and BaseStore.update() ❌
3. **src/pages/support/ticket/[token].astro:24** - Uses BaseStore.get() ❌

All three locations are trying to perform database operations in unauthenticated/server contexts using BaseStore, which requires client-side authentication.

**Working Implementation:**
- **src/pages/api/support/create-guest-ticket.ts** - Correctly uses AppwriteServer.withAdminKey() ✅

Now I'll formulate my complete analysis and recommendations.   │

│ Let me formulate the final analysis with actionable recommendations:

**ROOT CAUSE:**
Mixing client-side patterns (BaseStore) with server-side contexts (API routes, Astro pages) where there's no authenticated session.

**CORRECT PATTERNS IN CODEBASE:**

Pattern A: Authenticated client operations
- Use: BaseStore methods from composables
- Context: Vue components, client-side code
- Auth: User session required
- Example: Creating authenticated user tickets

Pattern B: Unauthenticated server operations
- Use: AppwriteServer.withAdminKey()
- Context: API routes, Astro pages
- Auth: Admin key (bypasses user auth)
- Example: create-guest-ticket.ts ✅

Pattern C: Client triggering serverless functions
- Use: Functions.createExecution()
- Context: Vue components
- Auth: Function runs with server permissions
- Example: EmailStore.sendContactEmail()

**VIOLATIONS:**
Attempting to use Pattern A (BaseStore) in Pattern B contexts (server-side).

**RECOMMENDATION:**
All server-side guest ticket operations should use AppwriteServer.withAdminKey() for database operations, matching the pattern in create-guest-ticket.ts.   │
