│ Analyzing the OAuth consolidation plan. The plan proposes moving 475 lines from useOAuthConnection.ts into useOnboardingFlow.ts (currently 1,019 lines), resulting in ~1,500 lines. First key question: Is this the right architectural decision?

The rationale is that useOAuthConnection is only used by ONE component (ConnectTriggerAccount.vue), making it an unnecessary abstraction layer. This is a valid point - single-use abstractions can add cognitive overhead without providing reuse benefits.

However, I need to verify:
1. Is it really only used by one component?
2. Will the resulting 1,500-line file be maintainable?
3. Are there other components in the onboarding flow that might need OAuth in the future?   │

│ Looking at the technical design, the plan uses clear section markers to organize the large composable:
- // ===== OAUTH CONNECTION STATE =====
- // ===== OAUTH COMPUTED =====  
- // ===== OAUTH METHODS =====
- // ===== OAUTH LIFECYCLE =====

This is a good pattern for managing large composables - VueUse uses similar section organization. The performance optimizations are also sound (shallowRef for large arrays, computed caching).

The data flow is well-documented: OAuth logic accesses onboardingData → calls useOnboardingOAuth helpers → updates onboardingStore → refreshes cache → user feedback. All state flows through single onboardingData atom.

Key architectural strength: Single source of truth. All onboarding state in one place eliminates the need to jump between files.   │

│ Examining the component migration (ConnectTriggerAccount.vue). The plan shows a clever pattern:

Before:
```typescript
const { isConnecting, handleConnect, ... } = useOAuthConnection('triggerConnection')
```

After:
```typescript
const { loadExistingAccounts: loadExisting, ... } = useOnboardingFlow()

// Wrap methods with connectionKey
const handleConnect = () => connect(data.value.platformTrigger, 'triggerConnection')
```

This creates wrapper functions that curry the connectionKey parameter. This maintains clean component code while allowing the composable to be more generic.

Potential issue: The component needs to manually wrap each method. This adds boilerplate. Alternative would be to create a helper that returns pre-bound methods, but that might be over-engineering for a single component.   │

│ The testing strategy is comprehensive:
- 15 unit test cases for OAuth functionality
- 10 integration test scenarios covering real OAuth flows
- 15 manual edge case validations

Notably, all 15 edge cases from requirements are listed for manual testing:
1. OAuth callback without account ID
2. Malformed OAuth URLs
3. Multi-account platform with zero related accounts
4. Duplicate OAuth processing prevention
... and 11 more

This is thorough. However, I notice the plan says "See phase5-testing/testing.md for complete test specifications" but doesn't show if these test files actually exist. This could be a gap - if the test implementation details aren't already written, the 4-6 hour estimate might be low.

The quality checklist has 80+ items mentioned, which suggests this plan is very detailed. Good sign for execution confidence.   │

1. Extend useOnboardingFlow (7 changes)
2. Update ConnectTriggerAccount.vue (2 changes)
3. Test manually
4. Delete useOAuthConnection.ts
5. Verify with typecheck/build/tests

The order makes sense - add new functionality first, migrate the consumer, test, then delete the old code. This allows for safe rollback at any point.

Critical question: What about the other files that might import useOAuthConnection? The plan says it's only used by ConnectTriggerAccount.vue, but I need to verify this with a codebase search before proceeding. If other components use it, the plan is incomplete.

Also need to check if the implementation details exist in phase4-implementation/implementation.md as referenced.   │

│ Examining the dependencies mentioned in the plan:
- Internal: useOAuth, useAuth, useTeam, useBilling, useNotification
- External: @nanostores/vue, @vueuse/core (already installed)

The plan says "No new dependencies required" which is good. But I need to verify that useOnboardingOAuth (referenced in imports) actually exists. The plan imports:
```typescript
import { useOnboardingOAuth } from '../vue/onboarding/utils/oauthHelpers'
```

This suggests there's already a helper file with the backend operations. Need to verify this file exists and contains: initiateOAuth, completeOAuthConnection, getExistingAccounts, activateRelatedAccount methods.   │

│ Risk analysis of the approach:

**Low Risk Factors:**
- Well-defined migration path (7 discrete changes)
- Comprehensive testing strategy (15+10+15 tests)
- Tagged rollback point (pre-oauth-consolidation)
- Only 2 files modified (useOnboardingFlow.ts, ConnectTriggerAccount.vue)
- Clear success criteria

**Medium Risk Factors:**
- Large file size (1,500 lines) - could become hard to maintain
- Manual method wrapping in component adds boilerplate
- 4-6 hour estimate seems optimistic given testing scope
- No confirmation that phase4-implementation/implementation.md exists with actual code

**Questions to answer through codebase research:**
1. Does useOAuthConnection.ts exist and have 475 lines?
2. Is it really only imported by ConnectTriggerAccount.vue?
3. Does useOnboardingFlow.ts exist and have ~1,019 lines?
4. Does oauthHelpers.ts exist with useOnboardingOAuth?
5. Do the referenced planning artifacts exist?   │

│ Overall assessment of the plan quality:

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive (includes requirements, architecture, implementation steps, testing, quality checklist)
- Clear success criteria and rollback strategy
- Performance considerations (shallowRef, computed caching)
- SSR safety maintained (useMounted guards)
- Well-organized sections with clear markers

**Weaknesses:**
- Assumes implementation details exist in referenced files that may not be created yet
- No verification that useOAuthConnection is truly single-use
- 1,500-line composable might be pushing maintainability limits
- Time estimate might be optimistic

**Recommendation:** Proceed with implementation BUT first verify:
1. All referenced files exist
2. useOAuthConnection usage count
3. Current state of both composables
4. Whether phase4-implementation/implementation.md has actual code

Then create a todo list and execute in phases with verification checkpoints.   │

│ Execution strategy:

**Phase 1: Verification (30 min)**
- Verify all files mentioned in plan exist
- Check useOAuthConnection.ts is only used by one component
- Confirm useOnboardingOAuth helper exists
- Review current useOnboardingFlow.ts structure

**Phase 2: Implementation (2-3 hours)**
- Add OAuth imports to useOnboardingFlow.ts
- Add OAuth state section
- Add OAuth computed section
- Add OAuth methods section
- Add OAuth lifecycle section
- Extend return statement
- Update interface

**Phase 3: Component Migration (30 min)**
- Update ConnectTriggerAccount.vue imports
- Add method wrappers
- Test locally

**Phase 4: Cleanup & Testing (1-2 hours)**
- Delete useOAuthConnection.ts
- Run typecheck
- Run build
- Manual OAuth flow testing

This gives 4-6 hours total, matching the plan estimate.   │

│ Final validation before execution:

The plan is solid and well-documented. The key decision is whether consolidating into a 1,500-line composable is the right architectural choice. 

Pro-consolidation arguments:
- Single source of truth for all onboarding state
- OAuth is tightly coupled to onboarding flow
- Eliminates unnecessary abstraction (single-use wrapper)
- Easier to understand complete flow in one place

Anti-consolidation arguments:
- 1,500 lines is large (but with clear sections, still maintainable)
- Future OAuth needs outside onboarding would require extraction
- Testing a large composable can be complex

Decision: PROCEED. The section markers and clear organization make the 1,500-line file acceptable, and the single-use nature of useOAuthConnection makes it a valid consolidation target.

Next: Research codebase to verify plan assumptions.   │
