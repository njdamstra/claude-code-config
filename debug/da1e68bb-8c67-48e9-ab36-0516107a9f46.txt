│ Starting implementation analysis. We have 9 files to modify and 2 new files to create. Let me think through the optimal implementation order to minimize breaking changes and ensure each step builds on the previous one correctly.

Key constraints:
- Migration files must be created first (but not run yet)
- Schema changes before backend code
- Backend before frontend
- Both OAuth paths must be updated together to avoid partial state

Let me plan the implementation sequence...   │

│ Implementation order should follow dependency chain:

PHASE 1: Create migration files (new files, no dependencies)
- addAuthScopes.ts
- migrateAuthScopes.ts
These are standalone and can be created first.

PHASE 2: Update schema (single field addition)
- oAuthProvider.ts: Add authScopes field to Zod schema

PHASE 3: Backend core logic (depends on schema)
- BaseOAuthManager.ts: Add getScopesForContext() method + modify initiateOAuth()
- GoogleOAuthManager.ts: Add scope merging in handleOAuthCallback()
- youtubeClient.ts: Remove forced consent prompt

PHASE 4: Frontend (depends on backend)
- SocialLoginButton.vue: Switch to API route
- oauthStore.ts: Add registration parameter
- AddAccountView.vue: Pass registration: false

PHASE 5: Configuration
- providers.json: Add authScopes field

This order ensures each step has its dependencies met. Should I verify there are no circular dependencies?   │

│ Checking for circular dependencies and integration points:

BaseOAuthManager.getScopesForContext() calls getEnhancedScope() which already exists, so no new dependencies there. It reads provider.authScopes which comes from schema - dependency satisfied in Phase 2.

GoogleOAuthManager.handleOAuthCallback() merges scopes from tokenResponse and existingOAuth - both already exist in the codebase. No new dependencies.

Frontend changes:
- SocialLoginButton needs getFingerprint import from @thumbmarkjs/thumbmarkjs - this dependency already exists in the project (used in other files)
- oauthStore gets new parameter but API contract is backward compatible (optional param)
- AddAccountView calls existing store method with new param

No circular dependencies detected. However, I should verify one critical thing: Does the getEnhancedScope() method in BaseOAuthManager handle the case where provider.authScopes might not exist yet (during transition period)?   │

│ Looking at the proposed getScopesForContext() implementation:

```typescript
protected getScopesForContext(provider: OAuthProvider, isRegistration: boolean): string {
  if (isRegistration && provider.authScopes) {  // ← Checks for existence
    return provider.authScopes;
  }
  return this.getEnhancedScope(provider);  // ← Fallback to full scopes
}
```

This is safe! The `provider.authScopes` check means:
- If authScopes exists AND isRegistration=true → use minimal scopes
- Otherwise → use full scopes (current behavior)

This makes the code backward compatible. Even if migration hasn't run yet, code won't break - it will just use full scopes until authScopes is populated.

However, I should add a log statement when authScopes is missing during registration to help debugging. Let me note this as an improvement.   │

│ Edge cases to handle during implementation:

1. **SocialLoginButton.vue**: Needs error handling for API route failures. Current plan has try/catch but should also handle network errors gracefully.

2. **Scope merging in GoogleOAuthManager**: The merge logic uses Set to deduplicate, which is correct. But need to verify tokenResponse.scope format matches our space-separated convention. From the code I saw earlier, it does.

3. **Migration script**: Should be idempotent (skip providers that already have authScopes). The plan includes this check - good.

4. **TypeScript types**: Adding authScopes as optional field won't break existing code, but should we make it required after migration? No - keep it optional for flexibility with other providers that might not need incremental auth.

5. **Testing during development**: Can test sign-up path immediately, but account connection path requires authenticated session. Need to test both paths separately.

Implementation looks sound. Should I proceed with creating a comprehensive todo list?   │

│ Implementation strategy finalized:

1. Create TodoWrite list with all 11 tasks (9 file modifications + 2 new files)
2. Execute in dependency order (migration → schema → backend → frontend → config)
3. Each file change should be atomic and testable
4. Add defensive logging for debugging (especially in getScopesForContext)
5. Verify each change compiles before moving to next

Total effort breakdown:
- Migration files: 60 lines (new) - 30 min
- Schema update: 1 line - 5 min
- Backend changes: 28 lines across 3 files - 60 min
- Frontend changes: 28 lines across 3 files - 45 min
- Config: 1 line - 5 min
- Testing/verification: After each phase

Ready to proceed with implementation. Starting with todo list creation.   │

│ Codex identified two critical issues with my scope merging implementation:

Issue 1: linkGoogleAccount() might be writing `this.provider.scope` instead of `tokenResponse.scope`
- this.provider.scope = the REQUESTED scopes (could be 3 or 11)
- tokenResponse.scope = the GRANTED scopes from Google (what we actually got)
- If linkGoogleAccount ignores tokenResponse.scope and uses this.provider.scope, we store wrong data

Issue 2: Scope merging only happens in isRegistration branch
- My code only sets existingOAuth in `if (isRegistration || !decodedState.userId)` block
- Workflow connection path (registration=false, has userId) skips this block
- Therefore existingOAuth is undefined, merging is skipped

Both findings appear VALID based on code structure. Let me verify by reading linkGoogleAccount implementation.   │

│ CONFIRMED: Both Codex findings are valid!

Found in linkGoogleAccount (lines 299-363):

**Bug 1 - Line 329 & 352:**
```typescript
// Update existing
scope: this.provider.scope,  // ❌ Uses requested scopes, not granted

// Create new
scope: this.provider.scope,  // ❌ Uses requested scopes, not granted
```

**Bug 2 - Line 314:**
linkGoogleAccount ALREADY calls findOAuthAccount(). My handleOAuthCallback code duplicates this lookup, and the merge logic only runs in one code path.

**Correct Fix:**
1. Move scope merging INTO linkGoogleAccount (where existingAccount is already fetched)
2. Change `this.provider.scope` to `tokenResponse.scope` (actual granted scopes)
3. Implement merge: if existingAccount exists, merge existingAccount.scope + tokenResponse.scope
4. Remove duplicate merging code from handleOAuthCallback

This ensures BOTH paths (registration + workflow) get scope merging.   │

│ Implementation plan:

**Step 1:** Remove buggy merge logic from handleOAuthCallback (GoogleOAuthManager.ts:127-152)
- Remove `let existingOAuth: OAuthAccount | undefined;`
- Remove the if block that sets existingOAuth
- Remove the scope merging if block
- Just pass tokenResponse directly (without spreading mergedScopes)

**Step 2:** Add scope merging to linkGoogleAccount (GoogleOAuthManager.ts:299-363)
- After `const existingAccount = await this.findOAuthAccount(...)`
- Add merge logic: combine existingAccount.scope + tokenResponse.scope
- Replace `this.provider.scope` with `finalScopes` on line 329 (update path)
- Replace `this.provider.scope` with `finalScopes` on line 352 (create path)

This fixes both bugs in one refactor. Let me implement this.   │

│ Implementation complete. Let me verify the fix addresses both issues:

**Issue 1 FIXED:** linkGoogleAccount now uses `tokenResponse.scope` (actual granted scopes)
- Line 331: `scope: finalScopes` (update path) ✅
- Line 354: `scope: finalScopes` (create path) ✅
- No longer using `this.provider.scope` (requested scopes) ❌

**Issue 2 FIXED:** Scope merging works for ALL flows
- linkGoogleAccount fetches existingAccount (line 301-305)
- Merging happens for ANY flow where existingAccount exists (lines 311-316)
- Registration flow: merges ✅
- Workflow connection flow: merges ✅
- No duplicate lookups ✅

**Data Flow Verification:**

Sign-up (new user):
- tokenResponse.scope = "openid email profile"
- No existingAccount
- finalScopes = "openid email profile"
- Stored: ✅ "openid email profile"

Sign-in (returning user with YouTube):
- tokenResponse.scope = "openid email profile" (minimal request)
- existingAccount.scope = "openid email profile youtube ..."
- Merge preserves all scopes
- finalScopes = "openid email profile youtube ..."
- Stored: ✅ All scopes preserved

Connect YouTube (add scopes):
- tokenResponse.scope = "openid email profile youtube ..."
- existingAccount.scope = "openid email profile"
- Merge combines both
- finalScopes = "openid email profile youtube ..."
- Stored: ✅ Merged scopes

Both bugs resolved!   │

│ Should I create a summary or just report to the user? Let me report the fix with clear explanation of what changed and why.

Key points to communicate:
1. Codex's findings were 100% valid - critical bugs
2. Both bugs fixed in GoogleOAuthManager.ts
3. Scope merging now works correctly for BOTH paths
4. Uses actual granted scopes (tokenResponse.scope) not requested scopes (this.provider.scope)
5. Single scope merging location (no duplication)

The fix ensures incremental authorization actually works as designed.   │
