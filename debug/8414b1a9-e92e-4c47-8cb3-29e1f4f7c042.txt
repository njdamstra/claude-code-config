│ Understanding the core problem: The workflow system generates multi-phase planning instructions. Each phase writes deliverables to `.temp/{feature-name}/phase1-{phase}/`. The issue is:

1. ALL phases currently use "phase1-" prefix (not phase1, phase2, phase3)
2. Templates reference outputs from PREVIOUS phases using hardcoded paths like `.temp/phase1-discovery/...`
3. We want to switch to `phase-{NN}-{name}/` (phase-01-discovery, phase-02-requirements, etc.)

The challenge: Phase templates need to reference MULTIPLE phase directories (current + previous), not just their own output_dir.   │

│ Analyzing cross-phase references in current code:

requirements.md (lines 10-16):
```
- Read `.temp/phase1-discovery/codebase-scan.json`
- Read `.temp/phase1-discovery/patterns.json`
- Read `.temp/phase1-discovery/dependencies.json`
```

design.md (lines 10-17):
```
- Read `.temp/phase1-discovery/codebase-scan.json`
- Read `.temp/phase1-discovery/patterns.json`
- Read `.temp/phase2-requirements/user-stories.md`
- Read `.temp/phase2-requirements/technical-requirements.json`
```

Wait - there's an inconsistency! design.md uses `phase2-requirements` but requirements.md uses `phase1-discovery`. Looking at line 113 of generate-workflow-instructions.sh: `output_dir: "phase1-${phase}"` - ALL phases get phase1- prefix.

So the actual issue is: design.md INCORRECTLY uses phase2-requirements when it should be phase1-requirements based on current implementation.   │

│ Solution for cross-phase references:

The plan says to use `{{output_dir}}` everywhere, but that only works for the CURRENT phase. We need ALL phase directories available in the template context.

Correct approach: build_phase_data should include ALL previous phase directories in phase_data JSON:

```json
{
  "phase_name": "requirements",
  "output_dir": "phase-02-requirements",
  "phase_dirs": {
    "discovery": "phase-01-discovery",
    "requirements": "phase-02-requirements"
  }
}
```

Then templates can reference:
```
- Read `.temp/{{feature_name}}/{{phase_dirs.discovery}}/codebase.json`
- Read `.temp/{{feature_name}}/{{phase_dirs.requirements}}/user-stories.md`
```

This solves the cross-phase path problem without hardcoding.   │

│ Analyzing Codex's gap #1 (backward compatibility):

The original plan includes helpers like get_phase_output_dir with "auto" detection for old/new formats, and a staged migration timeline. But Codex says "no logic that tries to account for both systems."

This means: CLEAN BREAK. No backward compatibility code. Just switch from phase1-{name} to phase-{NN}-{name} everywhere at once.

Implications:
- No get_phase_output_dir helper needed
- No migration timeline needed
- No "auto" detection logic
- Just update: calculate_output_dir() and use it everywhere
- Existing .temp/ directories may break, but that's acceptable (they're temporary)   │

Two approaches are described:
1. Lines 580-635: JSON-safe pipeline with jq -Rs, storing template_content/extension in phase_data
2. Lines 798-810: render_output_template just echoes fenced blocks

These are conflicting approaches for different use cases:
- Approach 1: For EMBEDDING template content IN phase_data JSON (for Mustache rendering)
- Approach 2: For DIRECT rendering of template files

The correct flow should be:
1. Load template from file
2. Escape for JSON with jq -Rs
3. Store in phase_data.deliverables[].template_content
4. Mustache renders it in phase template with {{template_content}}

One unified approach, not two contradictory ones. The plan needs to pick one and remove the other.   │

│ Analyzing Codex's gap #4 (extended conditional signature):

Current get_phase_subagents (lib/subagent-matcher.sh:10-31):
```bash
get_phase_subagents() {
  local workflow_json=$1
  local phase=$2
  local scope=$3
  # Returns subagent types to stdout
}

Plan's proposed version (lines 1056-1079):
```bash
get_phase_subagents() {
  local phase=$1
  local scope=$2
  shift 2
  local custom_conditions=(\"$@\")  # Bash array
  # But no workflow_json parameter!
}

The problem: Dropped workflow_json parameter, and uses Bash array for JSON data which doesn't work.

Correct approach:
```bash
get_phase_subagents() {
  local workflow_json=$1
  local phase=$2
  local scope=$3
  local conditions_json=$4  # JSON array: [{key: "complexity", value: "high"}]
  # Parse conditions_json with jq inside function
}

│ Analyzing Codex's gap #5 (validation fires too early):

The plan hooks validate_output_structure at end of output_full() (lines 343-404), but the problem is:
- output_full() generates INSTRUCTIONS, not actual directories
- .temp/{feature}/ doesn't exist when instructions are generated
- Validation would always fail

Correct timing: Validation should run AFTER subagents execute and write files, not after instruction generation.

Options:
1. Remove validation entirely (instructions are just instructions)
2. Make it a separate command that runs after workflow execution
3. Add validation hooks that run after each phase executes

Best option: Skip validation for now. The workflow generates instructions. Execution happens separately via fetch-phase-details.sh and Task tool invocations. Validation is a separate concern.   │

│ Synthesizing the corrected implementation approach:

PRIORITY 1: Output Directory Structure (NO backward compat)
- Add calculate_output_dir(phase_number, phase_name) → "phase-{NN}-{name}"
- Modify build_phase_data to:
  - Accept phase_number parameter
  - Calculate output_dir for current phase
  - Build phase_dirs map for ALL phases (1 to current)
- Update output_full to pass phase_number (1, 2, 3...)
- Update phase templates to use {{phase_dirs.phase_name}} for cross-phase references

PRIORITY 2: Template Override System
- Add check_template_override(workflow, phase) → template_path
- Try phases/{workflow}/{phase}.md first, fallback to phases/{phase}.md
- No changes to phase_data structure

PRIORITY 3: Output Templates System (ONE approach only)
- Load output templates from workflow YAML subagent_outputs section
- Escape with jq -Rs and store in deliverables[].template_content
- Phase templates render with {{#deliverables}}{{template_content}}{{/deliverables}}
- Remove the contradictory "just echo fenced blocks" approach

PRIORITY 4: Extended Conditionals
- Add extract_conditions(flags[]) → conditions_json
- Modify get_phase_subagents signature: (workflow_json, phase, scope, conditions_json)
- Parse conditions inside get_phase_subagents with jq
- Support YAML: conditional.{key}={value}: [subagents]

│ Final verification of implementation sequence:

Build order (foundation-first):
1. Priority 1 first (phase directory structure + phase_dirs map) - foundation for everything
2. Priority 2 second (template overrides) - independent feature, no dependencies
3. Priority 3 third (output templates) - depends on deliverables structure from Priority 1
4. Priority 4 last (extended conditionals) - modifies subagent matching

Key files to modify:
- generate-workflow-instructions.sh: build_phase_data, output_full, output_summary
- fetch-phase-details.sh: Same changes as generate-workflow-instructions.sh
- lib/subagent-matcher.sh: get_phase_subagents signature
- lib/scope-detector.sh: Add extract_conditions
- phases/*.md: Update ALL cross-phase references to use {{phase_dirs.*}}
- workflows/*.yaml: Add subagent_outputs (optional) and extended conditionals (optional)

Estimated effort: 8-12 hours implementation + 4-6 hours testing = 12-18 hours total (reduced from 22-32 by removing backward compat and validation)   │

│ Understanding the base directory requirement:

Current pattern: `.temp/{{feature_name}}/{{output_dir}}/file.json` (hardcoded .temp)
Desired pattern: `{{base_dir}}/{{feature_name}}/{{output_dir}}/file.json` (configurable)

Use cases:
1. Default: `.temp` for temporary workspace
2. Project-level: `.claude/plans` for persistent plans
3. External: `~/socialaize_config` for out-of-project storage

This needs to be:
- Configurable via CLI flag or env var
- Consistent across ALL path references (deliverables, cross-phase lookups, phase templates)
- Available in phase_data for Mustache rendering

Key question: Where does base_dir come from?
Options:
A) CLI flag: `--base-dir=.temp`
B) Environment variable: `WORKFLOW_BASE_DIR`
C) Workflow YAML config: `base_dir: .temp`
D) Default with override

Best approach: CLI flag with default fallback (option A+D)

│ Implementation approach for base_dir:

1. CLI Interface:
```bash
bash generate-workflow-instructions.sh new-feature-plan auth \
  --frontend \
  --base-dir=.claude/plans  # NEW flag
```

Default: `.temp` if not specified

2. Where base_dir appears in phase_data:
```json
{
  "base_dir": ".temp",
  "feature_name": "auth",
  "output_dir": "phase-02-requirements",
  "phase_dirs": {
    "discovery": "phase-01-discovery",
    "requirements": "phase-02-requirements"
  }
}
```

3. Template usage:
```markdown
<!-- Current phase output: -->
Write to: `{{base_dir}}/{{feature_name}}/{{output_dir}}/requirements.json`

<!-- Cross-phase reference: -->
Read from: `{{base_dir}}/{{feature_name}}/{{phase_dirs.discovery}}/codebase.json`
```

This makes ALL paths configurable and consistent.

│ Files that need updates for base_dir support:

**1. generate-workflow-instructions.sh:**
- Parse --base-dir flag (default: .temp)
- Pass base_dir to build_phase_data()
- Add base_dir to phase_data JSON
- Update output_summary() to show correct base path

**2. fetch-phase-details.sh:**
- Same changes as generate-workflow-instructions.sh

**3. lib/scope-detector.sh:**
- Possibly add extract_base_dir() function to parse --base-dir flag
- Or just parse it in main() directly (simpler)

**4. ALL phase templates (25 files):**
Replace every path reference:
- OLD: `.temp/phase1-discovery/file.json`
- NEW: `{{base_dir}}/{{feature_name}}/{{phase_dirs.discovery}}/file.json`

- OLD: `.temp/{{output_dir}}/file.json`
- NEW: `{{base_dir}}/{{feature_name}}/{{output_dir}}/file.json`

**5. Deliverables in build_phase_data():**
Add full_path to each deliverable:
```json
{
  "filename": "requirements.json",
  "output_dir": "phase-02-requirements",
  "full_path": ".temp/auth/phase-02-requirements/requirements.json"
}
```

This way templates can use `{{full_path}}` directly.

│ Directory validation and creation concern:

The workflow generation script generates INSTRUCTIONS, not actual directories. So we DON'T create directories during generation.

However, we should:
1. Validate base_dir format (no invalid characters)
2. Expand tilde (~) to home directory
3. Document that base_dir must exist or be creatable

When subagents execute and write deliverables, THEY create the directories:
```bash
mkdir -p "{{base_dir}}/{{feature_name}}/{{output_dir}}"
```

So our responsibility is:
- Parse and validate base_dir
- Expand ~ if present
- Add to phase_data
- Document expectations

Not our responsibility:
- Creating base_dir (happens during execution)
- Checking if base_dir exists (instructions are just instructions)

│ Template convenience patterns:

Instead of making templates always write:
`{{base_dir}}/{{feature_name}}/{{output_dir}}/file.json`

We can provide convenience variables in phase_data:
```json
{
  "base_dir": ".temp",
  "feature_name": "auth",
  "output_dir": "phase-02-requirements",
  "workspace": ".temp/auth",  // Convenience: base_dir + feature_name
  "phase_dirs": {
    "discovery": "phase-01-discovery",
    "requirements": "phase-02-requirements"
  },
  "phase_paths": {  // Convenience: full paths to each phase
    "discovery": ".temp/auth/phase-01-discovery",
    "requirements": ".temp/auth/phase-02-requirements"
  }
}
```

Templates can then use:
- Current phase output: `{{workspace}}/{{output_dir}}/file.json`
- Cross-phase read: `{{phase_paths.discovery}}/codebase.json`
- Or explicit: `{{base_dir}}/{{feature_name}}/{{phase_dirs.discovery}}/file.json`

This gives flexibility while maintaining consistency.

│ Complete base_dir implementation summary:

**CLI Changes:**
```bash
# New flag with default
--base-dir=<path>  # Default: .temp

# Examples:
--base-dir=.temp                    # Project workspace (default)
--base-dir=.claude/plans            # Persistent project plans
--base-dir=~/socialaize_config      # External config directory
```

**Code changes:**
1. Parse --base-dir flag in main()
2. Expand ~ to home directory
3. Validate format (no invalid chars)
4. Add to phase_data: base_dir, workspace, phase_paths
5. Update ALL 25 phase templates to use {{workspace}} or {{phase_paths.*}}
6. Update deliverables to include full_path

**Testing additions:**
- Test default base_dir (.temp)
- Test custom base_dir (.claude/plans)
- Test tilde expansion (~/config)
- Test invalid paths rejected
- Verify all templates use configurable paths

This adds minimal complexity (~1-2h extra) but provides crucial flexibility for different deployment scenarios.

Ready to update the plan.
