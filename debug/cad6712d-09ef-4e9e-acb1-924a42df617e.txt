│ First, I need to establish the current state. D3.js is ALREADY installed (v7.9.0 in package.json line 67) with TypeScript types (@types/d3 line 103). It's currently used in NetworkAnimation.vue for a force-directed graph. So the question is really about EXPANDING D3.js usage, not adding it from scratch. This changes the analysis significantly - we're looking at scaling existing usage, not greenfield integration.   │

│ Need to understand the current animation landscape in this codebase. From CLAUDE.md, they have:
1. useAnimation (2803 lines) - universal orchestrator with Web Animations API
2. useAnimateElement (335 lines) - simplified API with 13 presets
3. GSAP (installed) - timeline-based animations
4. VueUse Motion - Vue component animations
5. CSS keyframes in design-system.css
6. ECharts (line 69) for analytics charts

This is a VERY mature animation ecosystem. D3.js would need to justify its place alongside these tools. What unique value does D3 provide that these don't?   │

│ From the web research, key insights:
1. D3.js is "unmatched for control, animation, and interactive tooltip precision" - still #1 for bespoke data viz in 2025
2. GSAP is faster (20x than jQuery), framework-agnostic, better for general animations
3. Motion.dev claims to be 2.5x faster than GSAP for unknown values, 6x faster at unit conversion
4. D3.js has 1.9M weekly NPM downloads, 103K+ GitHub stars - very active
5. Astro supports "Islands Architecture" - only interactive parts hydrated

Critical distinction: D3 is DATA-DRIVEN visualization, GSAP is ANIMATION-DRIVEN. They solve different problems.   │

│ Looking at the codebase's domain - social media management platform. Where could D3 add value?
1. Analytics dashboard (already uses ECharts for 15+ chart types)
2. Network visualizations (already using D3 for NetworkAnimation.vue)
3. Social network relationship graphs
4. Post engagement timelines
5. Audience demographic breakdowns
6. Content calendar visualizations

ECharts vs D3 decision: ECharts is high-level (pre-built charts), D3 is low-level (custom everything). They complement each other.   │

Answer: When you need:
1. Custom interactions not supported by ECharts
2. Unique visual designs (force-directed graphs, hierarchical edge bundling)
3. Real-time data binding with complex DOM manipulation
4. Integration with non-standard data structures
5. Animations tightly coupled to data transformations   │

│ SSR compatibility analysis for D3 in Astro:
- Current NetworkAnimation.vue uses D3 in client-side Vue component
- Uses `onMounted()` hook - correct SSR pattern (waits for browser)
- Astro's Islands Architecture means D3 components would be client-only by default
- No SSR rendering needed for D3 visualizations (they require DOM/SVG anyway)

SSR concern is LOW. D3 naturally fits client-side rendering. Astro handles this elegantly with `client:load` or `client:visible` directives.   │

│ Performance considerations:
1. D3 is DOM-heavy (manipulates SVG directly) - can be slow with 1000s of elements
2. ECharts uses Canvas rendering (line 20 BaseChart.vue) - better for large datasets
3. Current NetworkAnimation has 50 nodes - reasonable for D3
4. Bundle size: D3 v7.9.0 is modular (can import only needed modules), full bundle ~250KB

Performance concern is MEDIUM. Need to be strategic about when to use D3 vs ECharts/Canvas.   │

│ Now need to identify specific use cases in this social media management platform where D3 would be superior to existing tools:

STRONG USE CASES (D3 wins):
1. Social network relationship graphs (follower networks, influencer connections)
2. Content propagation visualizations (how posts spread through networks)
3. Hierarchical team/account structures (org charts with custom layouts)
4. Interactive timeline visualizations with branching (post scheduling conflicts)
5. Custom force-directed layouts (already proven with NetworkAnimation.vue)

WEAK USE CASES (ECharts better):
1. Standard analytics charts (bar, line, pie) - ECharts is faster
2. Large dataset performance charts (10K+ data points) - Canvas > SVG
3. Real-time streaming data dashboards - ECharts optimized for this   │

│ Implementation approach analysis:

CURRENT STATE:
- D3 v7.9.0 already installed ✓
- @types/d3 v7.4.3 installed ✓
- One working component (NetworkAnimation.vue) ✓
- SSR-safe pattern established (onMounted, useMounted) ✓

EXPANSION STRATEGY:
1. Create reusable D3 composables following existing patterns
2. Integrate with useAnimation system for orchestrated animations
3. Follow component architecture (src/components/vue/graphs/D3*.vue)
4. Use modular imports to minimize bundle size

Example: import { select, forceSimulation } from 'd3' instead of import * as d3   │

│ CONS analysis:

1. **Steep Learning Curve** - Complex API, requires understanding of SVG/DOM manipulation
2. **Performance Limits** - SVG struggles with 1000+ elements (ECharts Canvas better)
3. **Bundle Size Risk** - Full D3 is ~250KB, must use modular imports vigilantly
4. **Maintenance Overhead** - Custom visualizations require more code than ECharts
5. **Team Knowledge Gap** - Developers need D3 expertise for maintenance
6. **Overlap Risk** - Could duplicate ECharts functionality if not strategic
7. **Animation Complexity** - Need to integrate with existing GSAP/useAnimation system
8. **Accessibility Challenges** - Custom SVG requires manual ARIA labels
9. **Mobile Performance** - Complex force simulations can drain battery on mobile
10. **Testing Difficulty** - Visual testing harder than ECharts declarative configs   │

│ Implementation approach recommendation:

PHASE 1 (Low-Hanging Fruit):
- Audit NetworkAnimation.vue patterns, create reusable composables
- Create useD3Force, useD3Scale, useD3Hierarchy composables
- Build 2-3 new visualizations: social network graph, hierarchical org chart, content timeline

PHASE 2 (Integration):
- Bridge D3 with useAnimation for coordinated effects
- Create D3 preset animations in useAnimationPresets
- Add D3 components to analytics dashboard as "Advanced Visualizations"

PHASE 3 (Optimization):
- Replace `import * as d3` with modular imports
- Add bundle size monitoring
- Performance testing with large datasets (transition to Canvas if needed)   │

│ FEASIBILITY VERDICT: **HIGHLY FEASIBLE**

Rationale:
- Already installed and working (NetworkAnimation.vue proof of concept)
- TypeScript integration proven
- SSR compatibility confirmed (Astro Islands + onMounted pattern)
- Clear use cases that ECharts cannot solve
- Modular architecture prevents bundle bloat
- Complements existing tools rather than replacing them

Risk level: LOW to MEDIUM
- Technical risks are low (proven working)
- Team knowledge gap is medium (requires D3 expertise)
- Maintenance overhead is medium (custom code vs declarative configs)   │

│ FINAL RECOMMENDATION: **EXPAND STRATEGICALLY**

Action Plan:
1. ✅ CONTINUE using D3 for network visualizations (current use case is perfect)
2. ✅ ADD 3-5 custom visualizations where ECharts falls short:
   - Social network relationship graphs
   - Hierarchical account/team structures
   - Interactive content propagation maps
3. ❌ AVOID duplicating ECharts functionality (bar/line/pie charts)
4. ✅ CREATE composable patterns for team reusability
5. ✅ DOCUMENT decision tree: "When to use D3 vs ECharts"

Key Success Factor: DISCIPLINE in scope - only use D3 when you need custom interactions or layouts that ECharts cannot provide. The temptation will be to overuse it because it's powerful, but that's where bundle size and maintenance debt creep in.   │

3. Data binding pattern: selectAll().data().enter().append()
4. Physics tick handler updating positions
5. Custom animation loop (propagateSignal) using RAF
6. Cleanup on resize: selectAll("*").remove()

These need to be extracted into composables with proper lifecycle management and TypeScript generics.   │

│ Clear picture emerging. Plugin contract shows:
- AnimationPlugin interface with setup/cleanup/lifecycle hooks
- SharedDataStore for cross-plugin communication
- Registry manages dependencies, conflicts, priority
- Plugins contribute to API via contributeToAPI()

D3 composables should:
1. Return selections + simulation refs (structure)
2. Expose control methods (play, pause, stop)
3. Handle cleanup automatically
4. Work standalone OR with plugins

Bridge plugins should:
1. Coordinate D3 simulations with animation timelines
2. Sync force physics with RAF coordinator
3. Apply animation presets to D3 selections
4. NOT create DOM structure (that's composables' job)   │

│ Cache insufficient, but user said no .md files, so I'll plan based on knowledge I have:

From Context7 docs: D3 tree layout, partition layout, force simulation patterns
From web research: D3 v7.9.0 modular architecture, TypeScript generics support
From NetworkAnimation.vue: Working patterns for SVG refs, force sim, cleanup

Key architecture decisions:
1. Composables should be STATEFUL (return refs, not primitives)
2. Follow VueUse patterns (reactive params, automatic cleanup)
3. Expose both high-level API (useD3Force) and low-level (useD3Selection)
4. Plugins should be STATELESS coordinators (no DOM creation)   │

- useD3Scale → Scale creation/management  
- useD3Zoom → Pan/zoom behavior

**Layer 2: Feature composables**
- useD3Force → Force simulation wrapper
- useD3Hierarchy → Tree/cluster layouts
- useD3Transition → D3 transition API wrapper

**Layer 3: Complete components**
- SocialNetworkGraph.vue → Uses Layer 1+2

│ PLUGIN ARCHITECTURE (Bridge pattern):

**Plugin 1: d3CoordinatorPlugin**
- Syncs D3 force simulation with useAnimation timeline
- Controls simulation alpha based on animation progress
- Coordinates multiple simulations

**Plugin 2: d3SelectionPlugin**
- Applies animation presets to D3 selections
- Bridges Web Animations API with D3 selections
- Animates groups of D3 elements

**Plugin 3: d3TransitionPlugin** (optional)
- Use D3's native transition API instead of Web Animations
- For D3-specific easing functions
- Fallback for browsers without WAAPI

Plugins do NOT:
- Create DOM structure (composables handle this)
- Manage force simulations (composables handle this)
- Handle data binding (composables handle this)

Plugins DO:
- Coordinate timing between D3 and useAnimation
- Apply animation effects to existing D3 selections
- Sync physics with RAF coordinator   │

│ TYPE DEFINITIONS PLAN:

Extend plugin-contract types.ts with:

```typescript
import type { Selection, Simulation, SimulationNodeDatum } from 'd3'

// Extend AnimationConfig for D3 integration
interface D3AnimationConfig extends AnimationConfig {
  d3?: {
    // Reference to D3 selection for animation
    selection?: Selection<any, any, any, any>
    
    // Reference to force simulation for coordination
    simulation?: Simulation<SimulationNodeDatum, undefined>
    
    // Coordinate animation with simulation alpha
    syncWithPhysics?: boolean
    
    // Use D3's transition API instead of WAAPI
    useD3Transitions?: boolean
    
    // Easing function (D3 or WAAPI compatible)
    easing?: string | ((t: number) => number)
  }
}

// Extend UseAnimationOptions
interface UseAnimationOptions {
  d3Coordinator?: D3CoordinatorOptions
  d3Selection?: D3SelectionOptions
  d3Transition?: D3TransitionOptions
}
```

This allows: useAnimation(svg, { d3Selection: { ... }, timeline: [...] })   │

**Before:** 169 lines, mixed concerns, `import * as d3`
**After:** ~80 lines, clean separation, modular imports

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { ref } from 'vue'
import { useWindowSize } from '@vueuse/core'
import { useD3Force } from '@/composables/d3/useD3Force'
import { select } from 'd3-selection' // Modular import!
import type { SimulationNodeDatum } from 'd3-force'

interface Node extends SimulationNodeDatum {
  id: number
}

const svgRef = ref<SVGSVGElement | null>(null)
const { width, height } = useWindowSize()

const nodes = ref<Node[]>(Array.from({ length: 50 }, (_, i) => ({ id: i })))
const links = ref(/* ... */)

// useD3Force handles simulation
const { simulation, isRunning } = useD3Force(nodes, links, {
  forces: {

│ IMPLEMENTATION PHASES:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1-3)**
- Create types.ts with D3 interfaces
- Implement useD3Selection (low-level, most reusable)
- Implement useD3Force (builds on selection)
- Write unit tests for composables

**Phase 2: Plugin Bridge (Days 4-5)**
- Extend plugin-contract types
- Implement d3CoordinatorPlugin
- Implement d3SelectionPlugin
- Add to plugin registry

**Phase 3: Proof of Concept (Days 6-7)**
- Refactor NetworkAnimation.vue using composables
- Test plugin integration with useAnimation
- Measure bundle size impact (should be <50KB with modular imports)
- Performance benchmark (60fps on 100 nodes)

**Phase 4: Additional Composables (Days 8-10)**
- useD3Hierarchy for tree layouts
- useD3Scale for scale management
- useD3Zoom for pan/zoom behavior
- Documentation examples for each

**Phase 5: Production Components (Days 11-14)**
- SocialNetworkGraph.vue
- TeamHierarchy.vue
- ContentTimeline.vue

│ TESTING STRATEGY:

**Unit Tests (Vitest):**
- Test each composable in isolation
- Mock D3 selections/simulations
- Verify reactivity (refs update correctly)
- Verify cleanup (no memory leaks)

**Integration Tests:**
- Test composable + plugin coordination
- Test multiple simulations syncing
- Test timeline orchestration with D3

**Visual Tests (Playwright - already in codebase):**
- Screenshot NetworkAnimation.vue before/after refactor
- Verify visual parity
- Performance benchmarks (FPS, memory)

**Bundle Size Tests:**
- Measure before: `import * as d3` (~250KB)
- Measure after: modular imports (~45KB expected)
- Add to CI checks (alert if >100KB)   │

│ DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

**For Composables:**
- JSDoc with examples for each composable
- TypeScript generics explanation
- Lifecycle behavior (when cleanup happens)
- Common patterns (with/without useAnimation)

**For Plugins:**
- Add D3 section to plugin-contract.md
- Example: Coordinating force simulation with timeline
- Example: Animating D3 selections
- Decision tree: When to use which plugin

**For Components:**
- NetworkAnimation.vue as canonical example
- Show before/after refactor
- Explain separation of concerns
- Performance considerations

**For Team:**
- When to use D3 vs ECharts (decision tree from earlier)
- Modular import patterns (critical for bundle size)
- SSR safety (always onMounted for D3)
- Common pitfalls   │

│ BUNDLE SIZE OPTIMIZATION CHECKLIST:

1. **Replace all `import * as d3`:**
   - NetworkAnimation.vue: Change to modular imports
   - Future components: Enforce via ESLint rule

2. **Create barrel exports:**
   ```typescript
   // d3/index.ts
   export { useD3Force } from './useD3Force'
   export { useD3Selection } from './useD3Selection'
   // etc.
   ```

3. **Plugin registration (lazy):**
   ```typescript
   // Only register D3 plugins when first D3 component used
   let d3PluginsRegistered = false
   const registerD3Plugins = () => {
     if (!d3PluginsRegistered) {
       registry.register(d3CoordinatorPlugin)
       registry.register(d3SelectionPlugin)
       d3PluginsRegistered = true
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Monitor with vite-bundle-visualizer:**
   - Add to package.json scripts
   - Run after each change
   - Alert if d3 bundle >100KB   │

│ SUCCESS METRICS (After Implementation):

**Technical:**
- ✅ Bundle size: D3 code <100KB (from 250KB)
- ✅ Performance: 60fps on 100-node force graph
- ✅ Cleanup: No memory leaks (test with repeated mount/unmount)
- ✅ TypeScript: 100% type coverage, no `any`
- ✅ Tests: >80% coverage for composables

**Developer Experience:**
- ✅ NetworkAnimation.vue: <100 lines (from 169)
- ✅ Reusability: 3+ components using useD3Force
- ✅ Documentation: Examples for each composable
- ✅ Team adoption: 2+ developers comfortable with D3 composables

**Architecture:**
- ✅ Separation: Composables handle structure, plugins handle motion
- ✅ Integration: D3 plugins work with existing useAnimation system
- ✅ Flexibility: Can use composables without plugins
- ✅ Extensibility: Easy to add new D3 composables/plugins   │
