│ Let me start by understanding the entry point. When a user invokes a workflow, they call `generate-workflow-instructions.sh` with parameters like: workflow name (e.g., "investigation-workflow"), feature name (e.g., "user-auth"), and flags (e.g., --frontend, --backend, --both).

The script first calls `initialize_workflow_context()` which does several things:
1. Parses flags (--frontend, --backend, --both, --base-dir, custom conditions like --complexity=high)
2. Extracts base directory (defaults to .temp)
3. Calls `load_and_validate_workflow()` which searches for workflow YAML files in priority order: project-level (./.claude/workflows/) → user-level (~/.claude/workflows/) → built-in (skills/use-workflows-v2/workflows/)
4. Returns a JSON context object with all parsed information

This is the initialization phase that sets up the entire workflow execution context.   │

│ Now let's look at what's inside a workflow YAML file - the workflow template itself. Using investigation-workflow.yaml as an example:

**Core Components:**
1. **Metadata**: name, description, estimated_time, estimated_tokens, complexity
2. **Phases Array**: Sequential list of phase names (e.g., problem-understanding → codebase-investigation → external-research → solution-synthesis → introspection → approach-refinement)
3. **Subagent Matrix**: A nested mapping structure that defines which subagents run in each phase
   - Structure: `subagent_matrix[phase_name][always]` = list of subagents that ALWAYS run
   - Structure: `subagent_matrix[phase_name][conditional][scope]` = list of subagents that run when scope matches (e.g., "frontend", "backend", "both")
   - Structure: `subagent_matrix[phase_name][conditional][condition_key=value]` = list that run when custom conditions match (e.g., "complexity=high")
4. **Subagent Outputs**: Maps subagent types to output filenames (e.g., code-researcher → codebase-analysis.json)
5. **Gap Checks**: Validation criteria for each phase with failure recovery options
6. **Checkpoints**: User approval gates after specific phases
7. **Template**: Final output template path

This YAML structure is the **blueprint** for the entire workflow execution.   │

│ Now the subagent resolution mechanism. When a phase is being executed, the system needs to figure out WHICH subagents to spawn. This happens in `get_phase_subagents()` in subagent-matcher.sh:

1. It extracts the "always" subagents for that phase from the workflow YAML
2. It checks if scope != "default" and adds conditional subagents for that scope (e.g., if scope="frontend", it adds all subagents in `subagent_matrix[phase][conditional][frontend]`)
3. It processes custom conditions from flags (e.g., --complexity=high adds subagents from `subagent_matrix[phase][conditional][complexity=high]`)
4. All these lists are combined and de-duplicated

Then for EACH resolved subagent type, `build_subagent_data()` looks up the subagent in registry.yaml to get:
- task_agent_type (which Task tool agent to use)
- thoroughness level
- description
- deliverable filename
- template path pattern

The registry acts as a **lookup table** mapping logical subagent names to their Task tool configurations.   │

│ Phase templates are the **execution instructions** for each phase. Looking at discovery.md as an example, it's a Mustache-style template with placeholders like:

- `{{feature_name}}` - simple variable substitution
- `{{#subagents}}...{{/subagents}}` - array iteration that loops through each subagent
- `{{#checkpoint}}...{{/checkpoint}}` - conditional block that only renders if checkpoint exists
- `{{^checkpoint}}...{{/^checkpoint}}` - inverted conditional (renders if checkpoint does NOT exist)

The template defines the STRUCTURE of phase execution:
1. **Step 1: Spawn Parallel Subagents** - Uses Task tool with each subagent's config
2. **Step 2: Wait for Completion** - Wait for all subagents to finish
3. **Step 3: Read and Review Outputs** - Read deliverable files
4. **Step 4: Gap Check** - Validate quality criteria, present user options if gaps found
5. **Step 5: Checkpoint Review** (optional) - User approval gate

Templates live in `phases/` directory with names like `discovery.md`, `requirements.md`, etc. But workflows can OVERRIDE these with workflow-specific versions or custom phases in their own directories.   │

│ The magic happens in `build_phase_data()` which creates a massive JSON object containing ALL the data needed to render a phase template. This is the **data context** for template rendering:

**Phase Context includes:**
- Basic metadata: phase_name, phase_number, feature_name, workflow, scope
- Directory paths: workspace, output_dir, base_dir
- Phase directory mappings: phase_dirs (maps phase names to their output dirs), phase_paths (full paths to previous phase outputs)
- **Subagents array**: Complete list of subagent objects with all their config
- **Deliverables array**: Built by matching subagents to their output templates
- Gap check criteria and options from workflow YAML
- Checkpoint configuration (if exists for this phase)

The deliverables array is particularly interesting - it's built by:
1. Looking at `subagent_outputs` in the workflow YAML
2. For each subagent, finding its output template configuration
3. Loading the actual template file from `output_templates/` directory
4. Creating a deliverable object with filename, description, template content, validation checks

This deliverables array tells the phase "what files should exist after subagents finish".   │

│ Now the subagent templates - these are the PROMPTS that get sent to individual Task tool agents. Looking at `code-researcher/investigation-workflow.md.tmpl`:

These templates are WORKFLOW-SPECIFIC. The path pattern is: `subagents/{subagent_type}/{workflow_name}.md.tmpl`

This means the SAME subagent (e.g., code-researcher) gets DIFFERENT prompts depending on which workflow it's in:
- `code-researcher/investigation-workflow.md.tmpl` - focused on problem investigation
- `code-researcher/new-feature.md.tmpl` - focused on feature discovery
- `code-researcher/refactoring.md.tmpl` - focused on refactoring analysis

The template tells the subagent:
1. What their specific task is in this workflow
2. What input files to read from previous phases (using `{{feature_name}}` and `{{output_dir}}`)
3. What output format to produce (JSON schema included in template)
4. Scope-specific focus areas (frontend vs backend vs both)
5. Success criteria

The subagent template gets rendered with phase context data, then that RENDERED content becomes the `prompt` parameter for the Task tool invocation.   │

│ Output templates are JSON/MD schema files that define the STRUCTURE of what subagents should produce. They live in `output_templates/` directory with names like:
- `codebase-analysis.json.tmpl`
- `requirements.json.tmpl`
- `architecture.md.tmpl`
- `bug-report.json.tmpl`

These templates serve multiple purposes:
1. **In subagent prompts**: They're embedded in the subagent template to show the expected output format
2. **In phase instructions**: They're shown in the "Read and Review Outputs" section so the main agent knows what structure to expect
3. **Validation reference**: Helps verify that subagent actually produced the right structure

The workflow YAML's `subagent_outputs` section maps subagents to these templates:
```yaml
subagent_outputs:
  codebase-investigation:
    code-researcher: codebase-analysis.json
```

This mapping can be:
- A simple string (filename only)
- An array of strings (multiple outputs)
- An array of objects with {filename, template, description} for fine-grained control

The system automatically matches template name to file, so `codebase-analysis.json` resolves to `output_templates/codebase-analysis.json.tmpl`.   │

│ The template renderer (`template-renderer.sh`) implements a Mustache-like templating system with three substitution types:

**1. Simple Variables** - `{{variable_name}}` 
Replaced with JSON values. Supports primitives, nested objects (as JSON), arrays (as JSON).

**2. Conditionals** - `{{#var}}...{{/var}}` and `{{^var}}...{{/^var}}`
- Positive conditional: renders block if var is truthy (exists, not null, not false)
- Inverted conditional: renders block if var is falsy

**3. Array Iteration** - `{{#array_name}}...{{/array_name}}`
Loops through array, rendering block for each item. Uses `{{.}}` for primitive items or `{{property}}` for object properties.

The renderer has **recursive capability** - nested arrays are processed recursively before variable substitution, allowing complex nested structures.

Rendering order matters:
1. Arrays first (most specific, handles nested structures)
2. Conditionals second (handles show/hide logic)
3. Simple vars last (fills in remaining placeholders)

This allows phase templates and subagent templates to have complex, data-driven structures.   │

│ Progressive disclosure is a key optimization feature. When `generate-workflow-instructions.sh` runs, it checks for `--summary` vs `--full` flag (default is summary mode).

**Summary Mode** (default):
- Outputs a lightweight overview (~2-5K tokens)
- Lists all phases with brief descriptions
- Shows command to fetch each phase on-demand: `fetch-phase-details.sh workflow phase-name feature-name flags`
- Benefits section explains 80% token reduction

**Full Mode** (legacy):
- Renders ALL phases immediately (~20-100K tokens)
- Loops through each phase, calling `build_phase_data()` and `render_template()` for every phase
- Outputs complete instructions in one massive document

The `fetch-phase-details.sh` script is the progressive disclosure mechanism:
- Takes: workflow name, phase name (or number 1-based), feature name, flags
- Calls same `initialize_workflow_context()` to get workflow data
- Validates phase exists in workflow's phase array
- Builds phase data for THAT ONE PHASE only
- Renders THAT ONE PHASE template only
- Returns focused instructions

This allows the main agent to work phase-by-phase, loading instructions just-in-time instead of all upfront.   │

│ Customization happens at multiple levels through a **hierarchy of overrides**:

**Level 1: Workflow YAML Customization**
Users can create custom workflow YAMLs in:
- Project-level: `./.claude/workflows/my-workflow.yaml` (highest priority)
- User-level: `~/.claude/workflows/my-workflow.yaml` (medium priority)
- Built-in: `skills/use-workflows-v2/workflows/` (lowest priority)

Custom workflows can:
- Define their own phase sequences
- Customize subagent matrix (which agents run in which phases)
- Add custom conditional logic (--my-flag triggers specific subagents)
- Override gap checks and checkpoints
- Specify different output templates

**Level 2: Phase Template Overrides**
The `check_template_override()` function searches in order:
1. Custom phase in workflow directory: `{workflow_dir}/phases/{phase}.md` (if workflow is custom)
2. Workflow-specific override: `phases/overrides/{workflow}/{phase}.md`
3. Default phase template: `phases/{phase}.md`

This means you can override a single phase for a specific workflow without rewriting the whole workflow.

**Level 3: Subagent Template Customization**
Each subagent has workflow-specific templates: `subagents/{subagent}/{workflow}.md.tmpl`
Creating a new workflow automatically allows different subagent prompts for that workflow.

**Level 4: Output Template Customization**
The `subagent_outputs` section in workflow YAML can specify custom output templates per subagent per phase.   │

│ Now let me trace the complete execution flow:

**Initialization:**
1. User runs: `bash generate-workflow-instructions.sh investigation-workflow user-auth --frontend`
2. `initialize_workflow_context()` parses args, detects scope="frontend", loads workflow YAML
3. Returns context JSON with workflow data, phases, scope, conditions

**Summary Generation (default):**
4. `output_summary()` prints overview with phase list and fetch commands
5. Main agent reads summary, decides to start Phase 1

**Phase Execution (per phase):**
6. Main agent runs: `bash fetch-phase-details.sh investigation-workflow 1 user-auth --frontend`
7. Script loads context, resolves phase name from number (1 → "problem-understanding")
8. `build_phase_data()` creates phase context:
   - Calls `get_phase_subagents()` to resolve which subagents (based on "always" + "frontend" conditionals)
   - Calls `build_subagent_data()` for each subagent (looks up in registry)
   - Builds deliverables array from subagent_outputs mapping
   - Includes gap checks and checkpoint config from workflow YAML
9. `check_template_override()` finds phase template (with override logic)
10. `render_template()` renders template with phase context data
11. Outputs complete phase instructions

**Main Agent Follows Instructions:**
12. Main agent reads rendered phase instructions
13. Spawns subagents in parallel using Task tool
14. Waits for completion
15. Reads deliverable files
16. Runs gap check validation
17. If checkpoint exists, asks user for approval
18. Repeats steps 6-17 for next phase

This loop continues until all phases complete.   │

│ Final synthesis - the system is a **multi-layer templating engine for workflow orchestration**:

**The Five Core Components:**

1. **Workflow YAML** = The blueprint. Defines phases, which subagents run when, validation rules, user checkpoints. Acts as declarative configuration.

2. **Phase Templates** = Execution instructions. Mustache templates that render into step-by-step instructions for the main agent. Tell agent how to spawn subagents, validate outputs, handle failures.

3. **Subagent Templates** = Task prompts. Workflow-specific prompts that get rendered and sent to Task tool. Different workflows can give the same subagent different missions.

4. **Subagent Registry** = Lookup table. Maps logical subagent names to Task tool agents and their configs (thoroughness, deliverable filenames, etc).

5. **Output Templates** = Data schemas. Define expected structure of subagent outputs, embedded in prompts and used for validation.

**The Customization Hierarchy:**
- Workflow level: Custom YAMLs in project/user/builtin directories
- Phase level: Override specific phase templates per workflow
- Subagent level: Different prompts per workflow
- Output level: Custom schemas per subagent per phase

**Progressive Disclosure Optimization:**
Instead of loading 20-100K tokens upfront, load 2-5K summary, then fetch each phase's instructions just-in-time as needed. 80% token reduction.

The genius is separating WHAT to do (workflow YAML) from HOW to do it (phase templates) from WHO does it (subagent registry) from WHAT format (output templates). Highly composable and customizable.   │
