│ Design challenge: DMs are visually different from posts:
- Posts: Platform icon + content lines (simulated post text)
- DMs: Should show chat/message UI (chat bubble? message thread? conversation?)
- Need to decide: What does a "unified DM" look like in the center grid?

Current center UnifiedGrid shows 4 cards with platform icons. If we're adding DMs, do we:
A) Keep 4 cards but show both posts AND DMs merged somehow?
B) Expand to 8 cards (4 posts + 4 DMs)?
C) Something else?   │

│ Component architecture approach - I see two main paths:

**Option 1: Generalize FlyingPostFromIcon**
- Rename to something like FlyingContentFromIcon or FlyingItemsFromIcon
- Accept items array with type discriminator: { type: 'post' | 'dm', ...data }
- Render different card styles based on type
- Pro: Keeps one component, less duplication
- Con: Component becomes more complex

**Option 2: Create parallel FlyingDMFromIcon component**
- Keep FlyingPostFromIcon as-is for posts
- Create FlyingDMFromIcon for DMs (similar structure, different card design)
- UnifiedPostsStage would need to orchestrate both
- Pro: Separation of concerns, cleaner component boundaries
- Con: More files, potential code duplication   │

│ Visual design for DM cards vs Post cards:

**Post Card** (current):
- Border with platform color
- Platform icon (small)
- 2 horizontal lines (simulated text content)
- Represents a social media post

**DM Card** (proposed):
- Should look like a message/chat UI
- Could have: chat bubble icon, message lines (shorter?), maybe a speech bubble shape?
- Different aspect ratio? Posts are portrait, DMs could be more square?
- Different border style? Maybe rounded corners more prominent?

Visual differentiation is key so users instantly recognize "ah, that's a post" vs "that's a DM"   │

│ Animation timing considerations:
- Current: 2 posts per platform with staggerDelay of 250ms between them
- Proposed: 1 post + 1 DM with same 250ms stagger
- Question: Should posts and DMs fly to the same center location or different areas?
- If same location: UnifiedGrid needs to handle both types
- If different locations: Need TWO center grids (one for posts, one for DMs)

Looking at the stagger pattern - both items would still animate sequentially (post first at 0ms, DM second at 250ms), maintaining visual flow.   │

- FlyingPostFromIcon receives scaled dimensions from parent (cardWidth, cardHeight, etc.)
- DM cards might need different dimensions than post cards
- Current: cardWidth: 64px, cardHeight: 80px (portrait aspect for posts)
- DMs: Maybe more square? 64x64? Or wider? 80x64 (landscape)?

- Should DM cards have different props?
- Pass both postCardDimensions and dmCardDimensions?
- Or generalize to itemCardDimensions with type-based rendering?   │

│ UnifiedGrid component considerations:
Looking at line 73-84 of UnifiedPostsStage.vue, the center uses UnifiedGrid component receiving:
- posts array with icon/color
- Various scaled dimensions

Current unifiedPosts array has 4 items (one per platform). If we add DMs:
- Need to also pass a unifiedDMs array? 
- Or combine into single unifiedItems array with type discriminator?
- UnifiedGrid would need logic to render different card types

UnifiedGrid component (not shown in files) would need significant changes to handle both post and DM card rendering.   │

│ Backward compatibility and migration:
- Need to check if UnifiedPostsTheater is used elsewhere in the codebase
- WorkflowsSection.vue imports and uses it at line 166
- If we rename components, need to update all imports
- Could keep old component as deprecated wrapper initially?
- Or do clean refactor with global find-replace?

Also need to check: Are there any other theater components that might follow similar patterns we should consider?   │

│ Recommended approach synthesis:

**Best approach: Hybrid with new component**
1. Keep FlyingPostFromIcon for post cards (minimal changes)
2. Create NEW FlyingDMFromIcon component for DM cards (similar structure, different visual)
3. Modify UnifiedPostsStage to render BOTH components per zone
4. Update center UnifiedGrid to show 8 cards (4 posts + 4 DMs) in 2×4 grid
5. Rename theater/stage to UnifiedCommunicationTheater/Stage

This approach:
- Minimizes changes to existing working code
- Clear separation between post and DM rendering
- Easier to maintain and debug
- More extensible for future content types   │

│ Final implementation checklist:

**Files to create:**
1. FlyingDMFromIcon.vue - New component for DM cards with chat bubble design

**Files to modify:**
2. UnifiedPostsStage.vue - Render both post AND dm components per zone, update data structures
3. UnifiedGrid.vue - Handle 8 items instead of 4, add DM card rendering
4. WorkflowsSection.vue - Update heading/description for unified communication

**Files to rename:**
5. UnifiedPostsTheater.vue → UnifiedCommunicationTheater.vue
6. UnifiedPostsStage.vue → UnifiedCommunicationStage.vue

**Key decisions still needed from user:**
- DM card visual design (chat bubble? message icon? what style?)
- Center grid layout: 2×4 grid? Or different arrangement?
- Should there be visual distinction beyond just different card content?   │

│ Problem: Animation is overflowing the allocated space in WorkflowSection.

Recent changes:
1. UnifiedGrid card height increased from `cardWidth * 1.1` to `cardWidth * 1.6`
2. This is a 45% height increase (1.6 / 1.1 = 1.45)
3. Cards are now taller to accommodate post section (55%) + DM section (45%)

Need to trace through the dimension system to find where the overflow is happening.   │

│ Dimension flow analysis:

BASE_VALUES in UnifiedPostsStage.vue:
- containerHeight: 384px (stage container)
- centerCardWidth: 144px (grid card width)
- Card height: 144 * 1.6 = 230.4px (NEW, was 144 * 1.1 = 158.4px)
- That's a +72px increase per card

Grid has 2 rows of cards, so total grid height:
- 2 cards vertically * 230.4px = 460.8px
- Plus gridGap (16px) between rows = 460.8 + 16 = 476.8px
- Plus label margin (16px) + label height (~20px) = 476.8 + 36 = ~512px

But containerHeight is only 384px! The grid alone is now 512px vs 384px container.   │

│ Options for fixing the overflow:

**Option 1: Increase containerHeight**
- Change BASE_VALUES.containerHeight from 384 to 520
- Pro: Simple one-line fix, maintains card sizes
- Con: Increases stage height by 136px, affects aspect ratio

**Option 2: Reduce card width**
- Reduce centerCardWidth to fit taller cards in same container
- Pro: Maintains container height
- Con: Cards become smaller, harder to see details

**Option 3: Reduce card height multiplier**
- Change from 1.6x back to something like 1.4x
- Pro: Smaller overflow, easier to fit
- Con: DM section gets cramped (currently 45% of card)

**Option 4: Adjust section split**
- Change post section from 55% to 50%, DM from 45% to 50%
- Pro: More balanced visually
- Con: Doesn't solve height problem, just redistributes space   │

│ Recommendation: **Option 1 - Increase containerHeight** is the best solution.

Reasoning:
- Cards need vertical space for dual content (this is the core feature)
- Reducing card size defeats the purpose (visibility matters)
- The 384px baseline was designed for single-content cards
- Dual cards naturally need more vertical space

Calculation for new containerHeight:
- Card height: 230.4px (144 * 1.6)
- Grid: (230.4 * 2) + 16 gap = 476.8px
- Label margin: 16px
- Label height: ~20px
- Total needed: 476.8 + 16 + 20 = 512.8px
- Round up for safety: **520px**

This increases container from 384px to 520px (+136px, 35% increase)   │

│ Side effects to consider:

1. **Aspect ratio impact:**
   - stageStyle uses `aspectRatio: '2 / 1'` (width is 2x height)
   - With containerHeight at 520px, aspect ratio still applies to overall stage
   - The responsive plugin scales everything proportionally
   - So the stage will naturally expand to maintain aspect ratio

2. **Grid plugin compatibility:**
   - Grid plugin defines: 3 columns × 3 rows layout
   - Center zone (column 2, row 2) contains UnifiedGrid
   - Increasing containerHeight affects overall stage dimensions
   - Grid zones will scale proportionally via responsive plugin

3. **Responsive scaling:**
   - baselineWidth: 960px
   - All BASE_VALUES scale from this baseline

│ Checking if there are any constraints from WorkflowsSection.vue:

From the file read earlier, WorkflowsSection.vue:
- Has theaters in rows (some full-width, some 50/50 split)
- Row 6 is UnifiedPostsTheater (100% full-width) at line 93-103
- Each theater wrapped in `<div ref="theater6">` with useDebouncedVisibility
- No explicit height constraints on the div
- Section uses `py-[var(--space-2xl)]` padding

So WorkflowsSection doesn't impose height constraints on theaters. The overflow is internal to UnifiedPostsStage trying to fit in its own containerHeight.

The fix is simply: **Update BASE_VALUES.containerHeight from 384 to 520 in UnifiedPostsStage.vue**   │

**Grid dimensions at 960px baseline:**
- centerCardWidth: 144px
- Card height: 144 * 1.6 = 230.4px
- Grid: 2 columns × 2 rows
- Vertical space: (230.4px card * 2 rows) + 16px gap = 476.8px

│ Alternative consideration - could we use CSS containment instead?

**CSS containment approach:**
- Add `overflow: hidden` to stage container
- Keep containerHeight at 384px
- Let content clip

**Why this is bad:**
- DM sections would be cut off (invisible)
- Defeats the purpose of showing dual content
- User can't see the full animation

**Verdict:** Increasing containerHeight is the only viable solution. The stage needs to be taller to accommodate dual-content cards. This is expected and correct.   │

│ Final recommendation and implementation plan:

**Root Cause:**
- UnifiedGrid cards changed from height = 1.1x width to 1.6x width
- At baseline: 144px width → 230.4px height (was 158.4px)
- Grid needs: 476.8px + 36px margins = 512.8px vertical space
- Container provides: 384px (containerHeight BASE_VALUE)
- **Result: 128.8px overflow**

**Fix:**
Change `BASE_VALUES.containerHeight` from `384` to `520` in UnifiedPostsStage.vue

**Impact:**
- Stage grows 35% taller (expected for dual-content cards)
- Responsive scaling applies uniformly to all dimensions
- No other theaters affected (each has own containerHeight)
- WorkflowsSection has no height constraints on theaters

**File to modify:** src/components/vue/animations/theaters/stages/UnifiedPostsStage.vue
**Line:** BASE_VALUES.containerHeight
**Change:** 384 → 520   │
