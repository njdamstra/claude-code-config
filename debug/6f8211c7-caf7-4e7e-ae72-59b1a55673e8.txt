Key observation: useAnimation in Stage layer uses plugins (responsive, grid, relationships, sequence) for coordination, NOT for animation execution. The actual animations are pure CSS in child components, controlled via class toggles like .is-active   │

1. Applies CSS classes (animate-active, animate-{preset}) to trigger animations
2. Sets CSS custom properties (--animation-duration, --animation-delay, --animation-easing)
3. Listens for animationstart/end/cancel/iteration events
4. Syncs with environment plugin (pause/resume on battery/fps/reduced motion)
5. Maps preset names to @keyframes (slideUp → slideInUp, fadeIn → fadeIn)

│ Current child component pattern vs cssAnimationPlugin:

Current (ShootingPosts, AiOrb):
- @keyframes defined in component's <style scoped>
- Class toggles (.is-active) trigger animations
- animation-play-state: paused/running for control
- CSS variables for dynamic values

With cssAnimationPlugin:
- Would need @keyframes in global scope or design-system.css
- Plugin applies animate-{preset} class instead of .is-active
- Plugin manages play state via class removal/addition
- Would lose scoped animation definitions

Key tension: Current pattern keeps animations co-located with components (better encapsulation), plugin centralizes them (better reusability)   │

│ PRO #1 - Unified lifecycle control:
If child components used cssAnimationPlugin, the Stage's useAnimation could directly control them via:
```typescript
animation.play() // Would cascade to all child cssAnimations
animation.pause() // Battery saver kicks in, pauses ALL animations
animation.stop() // Clean exit, all animations reset
```

Currently: Stage useAnimation has environment/responsive/grid plugins but no direct animation control. Children animate independently via CSS. Parent can't pause ShootingPosts or AiOrb animations through the animation API - it has to pass :active prop changes.

This is actually a MAJOR benefit - centralized animation lifecycle.   │

│ PRO #2 - Environment awareness propagation:
cssAnimationPlugin automatically integrates with environment plugin. Currently:
- Stage has environment awareness (battery, fps, reducedMotion)
- Stage computes effectiveActive = active && !environmentPaused
- Must manually pass effectiveActive to each child via props

With cssAnimationPlugin:
- Each child component's useAnimation(element, { cssAnimation: {...} }) would auto-pause on battery/fps drops
- No manual prop drilling needed
- Environment checks happen at the component level automatically

However, there's a question: would each child need its own useAnimation instance? That could be wasteful - currently ONE useAnimation in Stage coordinates everything.   │

Current: 1 useAnimation in Stage = 1 IntersectionObserver, 1 ResizeObserver, 1 RAF loop
With cssAnimationPlugin per child: 3-5 useAnimation instances = 3-5 IntersectionObservers, 3-5 ResizeObservers

This is inefficient! Each child component (ShootingPosts, AiOrb, FourCards, TheaterBeams) would need:
- Its own useAnimation(childRef, { cssAnimation: {...} })
- Duplicate environment monitoring
- Duplicate responsive calculations (though they could share via props)

However... looking at cssAnimationPlugin code, it doesn't require responsive/environment plugins. Could have:
- Stage: useAnimation with environment + responsive + grid (coordinator)
- Children: Lightweight useAnimation with ONLY cssAnimation plugin (executors)

This is actually possible! The plugin system is modular.   │

│ CON #2 - Loss of animation co-location:
Current pattern is beautifully simple for developers:
- Open ShootingPosts.vue
- See @keyframes fly-to-destination right there in <style scoped>
- Understand animation behavior without leaving file
- Tweak animation curve, modify keyframe percentages inline

With cssAnimationPlugin:
- Animation moved to design-system.css or global scope
- @keyframes fly-to-destination becomes animate-flyToDestination utility
- Must hunt through CSS files to modify animation
- Loses scoped encapsulation

This is significant for maintainability. Theater animations are UNIQUE - they're not reusable buttons/cards. fly-to-destination is specific to ShootingPosts, orb-pulse is specific to AiOrb. Why make them global?   │

│ CON #3 - Increased complexity for theater-specific animations:
Current approach:
```vue
<style scoped>
@keyframes fly-to-destination {
  0% { transform: translate(0, 0) scale(1); }
  100% { transform: translate(var(--target-x), var(--target-y)) scale(0.3); }
}
.duplicate-card.is-active { animation: fly-to-destination 1.5s ease-in-out var(--delay) infinite; }
</style>
```

With cssAnimationPlugin:
```vue
<script>
// Each duplicate card needs its own useAnimation instance?
const cards = ref([])
cards.value.forEach((card, i) => {
  useAnimation(card, {
    cssAnimation: { className: 'fly-to-destination', duration: 1500, delay: i * 400 }
  })
})
</script>
```

Wait, this doesn't work well for ShootingPosts - it renders 4 duplicate cards dynamically. Would need v-for with refs array, then setup useAnimation for each. Current CSS approach is simpler for multi-element animations.   │

│ PRO #3 - Event-driven animation callbacks:
cssAnimationPlugin provides lifecycle hooks:
```typescript
cssAnimation: {
  preset: 'fadeIn',
  onStart: () => console.log('Animation started'),
  onComplete: () => console.log('Animation completed'),
  onIteration: () => console.log('Loop iteration'),
  onCancel: () => console.log('Animation cancelled')
}
```

Current approach: No easy way to detect when fly-to-destination completes. Would need to add custom animationend listeners.

This could be useful for:
- Triggering next stage after completion
- Updating state when animation finishes
- Chaining animations programmatically

But is this needed for theaters? Currently they're infinite loops or controlled by :active prop. Not much need for completion callbacks.   │

│ CON #4 - Plugin conflicts with current patterns:
Looking at cssAnimationPlugin code line 84: conflicts: ['timeline']

This means cssAnimation and timeline are mutually exclusive. Currently theaters don't use timeline, but this is a philosophical issue:
- cssAnimationPlugin is designed for WAAPI-style control of CSS animations
- Current theater pattern uses pure CSS with minimal JS intervention
- Plugin adds complexity (class management, event listeners, cleanup) for what CSS already does natively

The plugin essentially "wraps" CSS animations to make them controllable via JS API. But theaters already control animations via:
- CSS variables for dynamic values
- animation-play-state for pause/play
- Class toggles for activation

Adding the plugin feels like abstracting something that's already simple.   │

│ Alternative integration approach - Hybrid pattern:
Instead of replacing current CSS animations, cssAnimationPlugin could be used selectively:

Stage layer: Keep useAnimation with environment + responsive + grid
Child components with complex sequences: Use cssAnimationPlugin
Child components with simple loops: Keep pure CSS

Example use case - if a theater needed:
```typescript
// Complex multi-step animation sequence
useAnimation(element, {
  cssAnimation: { className: 'intro' },
  onComplete: () => {
    // Chain to next animation
    useAnimation(element, { cssAnimation: { className: 'main-loop' } })
  }
})
```

But current theaters don't need this! They're:
- Infinite loops (ShootingPosts, AiOrb)
- OR controlled by sequence plugin timing (SchedulingTheater)

No complex chaining needed. Current pattern sufficient.   │

│ Performance comparison:

Current (pure CSS):
- 0 JS execution during animation (GPU handles everything)
- ~50 lines CSS per component
- No event listeners during steady state
- Browser can optimize @keyframes aggressively

With cssAnimationPlugin:
- Initial JS execution to apply classes + setup listeners
- 4 event listeners per animated element (start/end/cancel/iteration)
- WeakMap lookups on every cleanup
- Class add/remove on play/stop (triggers style recalc)
- 370 lines of plugin code included in bundle

For 4 duplicate cards in ShootingPosts: 16 event listeners
For 3 theaters on page: ~50 event listeners total

Not massive overhead, but measurable. Current approach is leaner for continuous animations.   │

│ PRO #4 - Standardized animation API across system:
If all animations used cssAnimationPlugin, developers would have ONE mental model:
```typescript
// Consistent pattern everywhere
const anim = useAnimation(el, { cssAnimation: { preset: 'fadeIn' } })
anim.play() // Start
anim.pause() // Pause
anim.stop() // Stop
```

Currently theaters have split mental models:
- Stage: useAnimation for coordination (responsive, grid, relationships)
- Children: Pure CSS with :active props and animation-play-state

This inconsistency can confuse developers: "Why does Stage have useAnimation but not for animations?"

Counter-argument: The split is intentional and semantic:
- Stage = coordination layer (useAnimation makes sense)
- Children = presentation layer (CSS animations make sense)

It's not inconsistency, it's separation of concerns.   │

│ Real-world integration example - how it would actually look:

ShootingPosts.vue WITH cssAnimationPlugin:
```typescript
const cards = ref<HTMLElement[]>([])
const cardAnimations = computed(() => 
  cards.value.map((card, i) => 
    useAnimation(card, {
      cssAnimation: {
        className: 'fly-to-destination',
        duration: 1500,
        delay: i * 400,
        iterationCount: Infinity
      }
    })
  )
)

watch(() => props.active, (active) => {
  cardAnimations.value.forEach(anim => 
    active ? anim.play() : anim.stop()
  )
})
```

ShootingPosts.vue CURRENT:
```vue
<div :class="{ 'is-active': props.active }" :style="{ '--delay': `${index * 0.4}s` }">
```

Current is 1 line. Plugin version is 15+ lines. For infinite loops with simple on/off, pure CSS wins on code simplicity.   │

│ Key insight - Plugin designed for DIFFERENT animation patterns:

cssAnimationPlugin is optimized for:
- One-shot animations (button clicks, page transitions)
- Animations with completion callbacks needed
- Dynamically starting/stopping individual elements
- Reusing global animation presets

Theater animations are:
- Continuous loops or long-running sequences
- Controlled by parent active prop, not individual triggers
- Theater-specific @keyframes, not reusable presets
- Multiple elements animating in sync with stagger

This is a fundamental mismatch! cssAnimationPlugin was designed for UI interactions (modals appearing, toasts sliding in), not complex theater choreography.

The current architecture already found the right pattern: useAnimation for coordination, CSS for execution.   │

│ Potential use case WHERE plugin WOULD help:

If theater needed dynamic animation swapping:
```typescript
// Swap animation based on user preference or context
const animStyle = computed(() => 
  userPreference.value === 'subtle' ? 'fadeIn' : 'popIn'
)

useAnimation(element, {
  cssAnimation: { preset: animStyle.value }
})
```

Current approach requires:
- Multiple @keyframes definitions
- Manual class swapping
- More CSS code

But again, do theaters need this? No. Each theater has ONE signature animation style. ShootingPosts will always "shoot", AiOrb will always "pulse". No runtime swapping needed.

The plugin's flexibility is unused in this context.   │

│ Exception case - Stage-level animation control need:

Currently Stage can't programmatically:
- Pause all child animations when battery < 20%
- Speed up/slow down animations based on user preference
- Smoothly restart animations after browser tab becomes visible

It relies on props (:active) and environment awareness is split:
- Stage monitors environment
- Each child checks props.active
- No unified control surface

With cssAnimationPlugin in children, Stage COULD:
```typescript
// In Stage - control all child animations
const childAnimations = [orbAnim, postsAnim, cardsAnim]
watch(() => shouldPauseAll.value, (pause) => {
  childAnimations.forEach(a => pause ? a.pause() : a.resume())
})
```

This is actually valuable for battery optimization and accessibility! Current pattern requires prop drilling.   │

│ Alternative solution - Provide/Inject pattern without plugin:

Stage could provide animation control context:
```typescript
// Stage
const animationControl = {
  shouldPause: computed(() => shouldPauseAnimations.value),
  speed: ref(1.0)
}
provide('animationControl', animationControl)

// Children
const control = inject('animationControl')
watch(() => control.shouldPause.value, (pause) => {
  el.style.animationPlayState = pause ? 'paused' : 'running'
})
```

This achieves centralized control WITHOUT cssAnimationPlugin overhead. Pure CSS animations remain, but Stage coordinates pause/resume state.

This is probably the "best of both worlds" - keeps CSS simplicity, adds coordination.   │

│ Final verdict synthesis:

Current architecture is CORRECT for theater use case because:
1. Theaters are continuous/long-running animations, not one-shot interactions
2. Pure CSS performs better for infinite loops (0 JS overhead)
3. Animation co-location with components aids maintainability
4. Each theater has unique @keyframes (not reusable presets)
5. Simple class toggle (:active) sufficient for on/off control

cssAnimationPlugin would ADD value if:
1. Theaters needed programmatic animation lifecycle events
2. Stage required direct pause/resume control over children (but provide/inject solves this)
3. Animation presets needed to be swapped dynamically (they don't)
4. Multiple useAnimation instances justified their overhead (they're not)

Recommendation: Keep current pattern, optionally add provide/inject for centralized pause control if battery optimization becomes priority. cssAnimationPlugin is excellent for UI interactions but overly complex for theater choreography.   │
