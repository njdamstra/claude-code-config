Looking at usage patterns - fetch-phase-details.sh is the newer, more advanced script with progressive disclosure. However, both are actively used. Best approach: modify both scripts for consistency, but fetch-phase-details.sh is higher priority since it's designed for comprehensive phase information display.   │

│ Final synthesis: The enhancement requires modifying fetch-phase-details.sh (primary) and fetch-phase.sh (secondary) to extract outputs[].schema from phase YAML, read template files from output_templates/, and display them in code fences with appropriate syntax highlighting. Key implementation points: 1) Use jq to extract schema field for each output, 2) Check template file exists before displaying, 3) Detect file type for syntax highlighting (.json.tmpl→```json, .md.tmpl→```markdown), 4) Handle missing schemas gracefully, 5) Support multiple outputs per phase. This provides agents with complete structural guidance, reducing ambiguity and increasing output consistency across workflow executions.   │

│ Bonus consideration: This enhancement also serves as a template validation mechanism. By displaying templates when phases are fetched, we'll immediately discover which templates are incomplete placeholders vs fully structured schemas. This creates a feedback loop for template improvement - as workflows are used, gaps become visible. We should document this benefit in the implementation notes so future maintainers understand the diagnostic value of template display beyond just agent guidance.   │
